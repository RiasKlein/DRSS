WELCOME TO THE 2014 ANNUAL REPORT FROM NPR
THIS WAS A YEAR MARKED BY NEW FRONTIERS
AND FOCUSED VISION AT NPR. In July, we welcomed
our new CEO and President, Jarl Mohn, to NPR. An
experienced media executive with a passion for public
radio, he is looking to elevate NPR's ambitions across
the organization. In just his first few months, he made
changes to prepare NPR to connect with an increasingly
diverse audience, pushed for greater innovation in
how we connect with audiences, and inspired greater
collaboration between NPR and Member Stations.
Under our new President and CEO, NPR is making
strides in living out the strategic aspirations articulated
in our strategic plan: "We will be the model for high
quality journalism in the 21st century, strengthening the
cultural, civic and social fabric of our democracy. We
will build on our heritage as reporters and storytellers,
on our intimate relationship with audiences, and on our
capacity for innovation in order to create a space where
audiences congregate, connect and contribute to a shared
understanding of the wider world. We strive to feed
the mind and satisfy the soul."
In 2014, we expanded our vision, strategy, and execution
for innovative projects that extend NPR's reach to new
audiences across broadcast and digital platforms, and
brought NPR into communities in new ways through
live events.
In our News division, we created new opportunities to
bring NPR host Michel Martin's voice, perspective, and
experience to audiences through "NPR Presents Michel
Martin," a new live events series across the country, as
well as a greater presence across NPR News programs.
In her new role, Martin is taking the studio to the story,
going where the nation's most important conversations
are happening. Today Martin is telling these stories from
their epicenters and in partnership with NPR Member
Stations, giving local stories national resonance.
Martin and NPR's Code Switch team led the way in NPR's
coverage of the unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, surrounding
Officer Darren Wilson's fatal confrontation with the
unarmed Michael Brown, and the national dialogue it
inspired. NPR and NPR Member Station St. Louis Public
Radio covered the massive public response, putting
themselves on the front lines in order to report on the
interactions between police and protestors. With St. Louis
Public Radio, Martin hosted a community conversation
that brought diverse points of view to the forefront for
thoughtful and impassioned discussion.
Our ambition is to take these kinds of stories everywhere
that our audiences are seeking them. To expand the
stories we tell, and how we tell them.
We've embraced technology and a multi-platform
approach to our work to deepen our coverage and bring
NPR to audiences who have not yet discovered us. In
March, NPR became the first news provider on iTunes
Radio, launching a 24-hour stream offering a whole
new way to listen to the NPR newscasts, stories, and
programming that our audiences love. We then delivered
on a promise to expand that listening experience even
further with local streams from across the country.
In the fall, we launched NPR One, a groundbreaking public
radio audio app that connects listeners to a stream of
public radio news and stories curated for them. Informing,
engaging, inspiring and surprising, it's an entirely new way
for NPR to present audio content in the digital world. NPR
One seamlessly presents reports from local NPR Member
Station alongside national news and features from NPR.
NPR is taking our stories to listeners in new ways, and
bringing our staff into new areas of the world. In 2014,
we announced the upcoming opening of a new bureau
in Seoul. Our goal is to expand our coverage of Asia and
complement the work of our bureaus in Islamabad, New
Delhi, Shanghai, and Beijing. At a time when other news
SPONSORS

Fiscal Year 2014 | 4
organizations have reduced international coverage, NPR's
17 foreign news bureaus are covering some of the most
important stories of our time, including the rise of ISIS in
the Middle East and the outbreak of Ebola in West Africa.
Elise Hu, who covers the intersection of technology and
culture for NPR's on-air, online and multimedia platforms,
will take on a new role as NPR's Seoul reporter.
Thanks to NPR's ongoing commitment to international
news coverage, we had our international team throughout
the world on the ground to provide coverage of the
biggest news stories in 2014: Gregory Warner reporting
on Crimea; Ari Shapiro and Emily Harris reporting on the
latest conflict between Israel and Hamas; Anthony Kuhn
reporting from Beijing on the missing Malaysia airliner and
the tragic ferry boat sinking in South Korea; Corey Flintoff
reporting from Donetsk on the Malaysia Airline shot down
over eastern Ukraine; Leila Fadel in Erbil reporting on the
resurgence of fighting in Iraq due to the rise of ISIS.
As Ebola flared in Africa, NPR's Ofeiba Quist-
Arcton joined NPR's Global Health and Development
Correspondent Jason Beaubien, photojournalist David
Gilkey, and quickly expanding teams of NPR reporters and
producers to bring this critical story home. Experienced
correspondents found themselves in 360-degree danger
zones, as they worked to cover the disease and its impact
as safely as possible. As Ebola made its way to the U.S.,
our science team, having spent months covering the
epidemic, cut through the fears to report on the facts on
the possible spread of the disease in this country.
Throughout 2014, NPR continued to explore the world
around us with series like "Borderland: Dispatches From
the U.S.-Mexico Boundary" and the special "Heirs of the
Revolution: A Changing Cuba" and our extensive coverage
of Brazil as the country geared up to host the World Cup
and the 2016 Olympic summer games.
News from around the world wasn't the only thing
keeping our reporters busy. Here at home the country
faced a midterm election. Leading up to the elections and
as the ballots closed across the country, our political team
was on hand to provide extensive coverage and analysis
on the candidates, the issues, and the challenges faced
in this year's election cycle. On NPR.org, we launched an
Election Night Party, an interactive tool that allowed users
to track results from ballot measures, congressional and
gubernatorial races, alongside live blogging and social
media updates from NPR.
Our spirit of innovation and commitment to our mission
continued to earn NPR the respect and appreciation of
audiences across the nation, and our peers in journalism.
Among our honors this year, NPR was awarded two
duPont-Columbia Awards, one of the most highly-
regarded recognitions in journalism. The NPR News
investigative series "Guilty And Charged," which offered
startling evidence of a two-tiered justice system that
more harshly punishes the poor with costs and fees,
and "`Planet Money Makes A T-Shirt," our multi-platform
collaboration between Planet Money and the NPR Visuals
team, each were honored.
Across the organization, NPR embraced innovation, taking
a new look at what we've been doing to create something
even more valuable to our audiences.
In the fall, NPR Music joined with Member Station WBGO,
and Jazz at Lincoln Center to create the next generation
of jazz programming from public radio: Jazz Night in
America. Hosted by multiple Grammy Award-winning
musician Christian McBride, Jazz Night in America presents
content on multiple platforms and from across the nation
to share this uniquely American art form for audiences
today, connecting jazz enthusiasts and potential new fans
with artists and venues -- and each other -- through weekly,
one-hour broadcasts and an array of 26 live signature
SPONSORS

videocasts and on-demand video of jazz events from
today's great artists and venues. Jazz Night in America
is also regularly featured on NPR newsmagazines,
including artist profiles, features, and interviews.
And in 2014 NPR's previously digital-only Alt.Latino
program came to the airwaves as a discrete program,
building on the audience it has attracted as a web program
and podcast, in its new incarnation. Every week,
Alt.Latino introduces listeners to new alternative Latin
music, including diverse genres such as cumbia, Mexican
garage rock, Panamanian rap, heavy metal mariachi and
many more boundary-blurring sounds from around the
world. In addition to music, Alt.Latino features interviews
and insightful conversation about Latin events and culture.
Through news and music, NPR and Member Stations
are reaching out to audiences wherever they are. We're
embracing the digital media world and bringing truth
to a saying we have at NPR, "Today's public radio isn't
going away, it's going everywhere."
THANK YOU FOR BEING PART OF OUR STORY.
