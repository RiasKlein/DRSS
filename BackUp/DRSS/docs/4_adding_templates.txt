		ADDING NEW TEMPLATES
To add a new template to the system, the following steps must be followed.

1) Create a directory in ./nonprofits/ with the name of the
nonprofit that you are adding a template for.
	For example: If adding a template for the Red Cross,
	create a directory named "Red Cross" (or "Red Cross Foundation",
	or any variant that you prefer).

What this does:
	Now when a user visits "upload_pdfs/", the name of the folder you 
	just added will be listed as an option for a non-profit to associate
	the uploaded files with.

2) Move your custom template into the directory you just created,
and rename it to "template.py".
	For example: Now your file would be 
	./nonprofits/Red Cross/template.py
- Note: that this one file should contain all necessary functions
		and meet the following requirements.

3) template.py's function for parsing must be called "readTemplate"
- Note: thus no main() function is needed
		as this function will be imported, not run as its own program.

4) readTemplate() must take exactly two parameters:
	- an absolute path to the filename that will be parsed and read in
	(for example, ./nonprofits/NatGeo/uploaded_pdf1.txt)
	- an absolute path to the filename that the results will be written out to
	(for example, ./nonprofits/NatGeo/out_uploaded_pdf1.txt)
		- the path the file is written out to be must be the name of the
		file that was read in, preceded by the string "out_"
- This is for concurrency reasons, as having a single "out.txt" output file
means that multiple users cannot simultaneously upload pdfs for the same 
nonprofit, as their requests would be overwriting one another's "out.txt".

5) The parsed output file must meet the following requirements:
	Each line containing a donation amount (or range) must use the format
		>>> Donation Amount: ###
	where ">>> Donation Amount: " is a literal string, and ### is whatever amount
	value is being used for that entry.

	Each line containing a donor name must contain only the donor name itself, for example:
		McDonald's Corporation
		Walmart Foundation
		Wawa

And that's it!
