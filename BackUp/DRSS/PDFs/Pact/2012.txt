capacity development
Pact believes solutions adapted
to local contexts and designed in
partnership with the people who
carry them out are the most likely
to succeed in the long run. Pact’s
brand of capacity development
puts the power of international best
practices in service delivery, financial management,
project management, monitoring and evaluation in
the hands of people who have a vested interest in the
development of their community.
• 	Pact’s pioneering Capacity Development Marketplace
– a market-driven approach to matching local
organizations with the services they need most --
expanded to Kenya from Ukraine and Belarus, with
some national aid agencies’ beginning to require such
marketplaces in their projects.
• 	Pact’s Organization Performance Index, which
measures improvement in local organizations using
uniform standards, reaches more than 300 nonprofits
in 17 countries and is internationally recognized.
We develop
people’s abilities
to contribute
towards positive
social change.
