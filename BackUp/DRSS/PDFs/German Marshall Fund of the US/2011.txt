ronald d. asmus, 1958-2011
in 2011, the german marshall
fund lost a dear colleague
and friend. ronald d. asmus,
the executive director of gmf’s
brussels office, died after a
long battle with cancer on
april 30. many people will
remember him for his work as
deputy assistant secretary of
state in the 1990s, when he
pushed to enlarge nato into
central and eastern europe.
but we remember him for the
lasting impression he made on
this organization. he pressed
gmf to expand our research
program, to develop new
programming in the middle east, asia, and the caucasus, and
to launch brussels forum, our signature event. without ron’s
bold ideas, deep intellect, and unrelenting curiosity, gmf
would be a different organization today.
2011 annual report 3
letter from the president
As the German Marshall
Fund celebrates its 40th
anniversary in 2012, this
moment of reflection also
offers an opportunity to
chart a new course for the
transatlantic relationship
— one that will keep the
historic partnership vital
to global affairs even as
the geopolitical landscape
continues to change.
Domestic problems, external
competition, and a lack
of common purpose have
imperiled the transatlantic
relationship. New chal-
lenges in Africa, Asia, and
the Middle East have tested
the ability and capacity
of the alliance to operate
effectively out-of-area. The
financial crisis has weak-
ened the United States and
Europe and raised serious
questions about the efficacy
of the liberal economic
model. The conflicts in Iraq
and Afghanistan have tested
both sides of the Atlantic
and underscored differences
in outlook and strategy.
And, as data from our
Transatlantic Trends survey
shows, there is a growing
transatlantic gap in attitudes
on the use of force, the
threats we collectively face,
and the role of Asia in the
global community.
Some see this situation as
indicative of the inevitable,
irreversible decline of the
transatlantic partnership.
That prognosis could prove
correct without serious
efforts to revitalize the
Atlantic community. Invest-
ment and trade will provide
some basis for cooperation
across the Atlantic. But,
economics are not enough
to sustain a real partnership,
especially when both the
United States and Europe
are being pulled in so many
different directions. Trying
to maintain the status quo
will ultimately lead to a situ-
ation in which the United
States and Europe no longer
see themselves as compre-
hensive allies but rather
as tactical partners when
and if there are compelling
common interests.
So we must pursue a growth
strategy for the transatlantic
relationship. It is the only
viable course for a strong
transatlantic community.
We must rethink and
reinvent this partnership
and make it work for the
21st
century or else see
our collective influence
outstripped by new powers
and new coalitions. That
may mean an alliance that is
less about hard power than
in the past, and it may mean
an alliance that includes
new partners who share U.S.
and European values, such
as Japan, India, Brazil, South
Korea, and Australia. It may
mean significantly altering
NATO, the G20, and other
institutions dominated by
the transatlantic community
and building new, more
global organizations and
arrangements that meet the
needs of this century while
retaining a core of Western
like-mindedness. Reinven-
tion does not mean starting
german marshall fund of the united states
4
anew. It does mean that we
must take a hard look at
the current arrangements
and keep those elements
that work while, at the same
time, thinking creatively
about how to build a
new partnership based
on common values and a
broader purpose and scope.
There are three steps to this
reinvention, and GMF is
working on each of them.
First, we have to take care
of ourselves. The United
States and Europe must help
one another get through
the financial and economic
crises through direct finan-
cial support and through
advice and the exchange of
ideas. Our economies are
deeply intertwined — U.S.
investment in Europe is four
times higher than in Asia,
and the transatlantic econo-
mies still comprise almost
half of global GDP. In good
times, this means growth
for our companies and
financial stability for our
countries. In bad times, it
means our economies aren’t
immune to the troubling
financial ripples — or waves
— that reach our shores.
GMF’s EuroFuture project
is contributing research,
analysis, and convening
power to this effort, and our
Transatlantic Taskforce on
Trade and Investment has
recommended steps toward
a new agenda for growth. In
addition, without working
to strengthen our cities and
local regions, there will
be little appetite for atten-
tion to global matters. Our
Urban and Regional Policy
program is devoted to
helping cities in the United
States and Europe develop
sustainably and recover
economically.
we must build new
organizations
and arrangements
for this century
while maintaining
a western core of
like-mindedness.
Second, we must expand
the partnership to include
liberal democracies that
share our values and can
provide new energy to our
common vision for a good
and decent world. One place
to start is the Atlantic basin
to our south, with Brazil
as the most prominent of
a group of democracies in
South America and Africa
that can contribute to global
stability. Then there is Asia,
where there are more people
living under democracy
than in any other part of
the world. Americans and
Europeans must approach
these new partners with
a sense of humility. Over
a decade when emerging
powers have enjoyed
historic and sustained
rates of economic growth,
we have not managed our
own affairs very well, and
our management of global
institutions has fallen short.
We need these new partners
to work with us in a process
of revitalizing the global
order to reflect more closely
our common values. Rather
than weakening the West,
partnerships with these
“global swing states” can,
over time, help strengthen
the liberal international
order the Atlantic commu-
nity built. They share our
vision of a good and decent
world and can work with us
to help integrate that other
rising giant, China, into it.
The democratic-capitalist
ideal can be reinforced
rather than undermined as a
growing number of non-
Western powers embrace
values that appear increas-
ingly universal, and as rising
democracies develop the
capacities to help us provide
global public goods. Our
2011 annual report 5
new Atlantic Dialogues
project and our standing
program on Asia are
working toward this end.
We talk a lot about “global
problems,” and it is not
lip service. Although once
largely separate, the lines
between “Atlantic” prob-
lems and “Pacific” ones
have blurred significantly,
and they should be tackled
together in most cases.
This brings me to the third
step. These new partner-
ships of liberal democracies
that connect the Atlantic
and Pacific realms should
address global security in
a broad sense to include
food, energy, migration,
economics, democracy,
law, and other aspects of
human security. These are
the baseline concerns of our
societies as they attempt to
grow and flourish.
the lines between
“atlantic”
problems and
“pacific” ones
have blurred
significantly.
GMF has gone through
several evolutions in its
history, tracking or even
leading changes in the
transatlantic relation-
ship itself. As the first U.S.
organization to open an
office in East Berlin after the
Berlin Wall fell, we were at
the vanguard of working in
Central and Eastern Europe.
We were on the front lines
of NATO expansion to
include many of those
countries. We continue
to work in the Balkans,
the Black Sea region, and
Turkey — areas that can be
integrated further still into
Euroatlantic structures. And
our seven offices in Europe
have us uniquely positioned
to integrate local, regional,
and global perspectives
in confronting the world’s
challenges.
In recent years, GMF has
talked about looking at the
world through a transat-
lantic lens. It’s not just that
anymore. We now need the
Brazilians, the Japanese, and
the Indians to look with us.
Their perspectives — and
growing willingness to
play a shaping role in East
Asia, North Africa and the
Middle East, and Iran —
will help all of us live in a
safer and more prosperous
world.

transatlantic forum on migration
and integration
Over the past four years,
the Transatlantic
Forum on Migration and
Integration (TFMI), held
in partnership with the
Robert Bosch Stiftung, has
established itself as a leading
international platform for
young professionals to
debate crucial immigration
and integration issues. After
past years in Germany and
the United States, predomi-
nantly immigrant-receiving
countries, and Turkey, a
country of emigration and
transit migration, TFMI
2011 moved to India to
further understanding about
immigration and integration
in a non-Western society.
The main topics discussed
at the October 2011 event
included diaspora relations
and emigration to the Gulf
States. This TFMI assem-
bled a group of 50 young
professionals in India from
Europe, the United States,
Morocco, Turkey, Mexico,
China, and the Philippines.
Apart from the annual
conference, TFMI has
developed into a sustain-
able network that supports
multiple networking activi-
ties throughout the year.
TFMI Fellows organize
spin-off projects in all parts
of the world, including
study tours, workshops,
regional meetings, and
professional exchanges.
Overall, the network
consists of more than 100
Fellows from over 30 coun-
tries worldwide.
mediterranean strategy group
The Mediterranean
Strategy Group brings
together 30-40 officials,
experts, and private sector
representatives for informal,
off-the-record discussions
on key policy questions
affecting the region. The
fifth meeting of the group
was held in Barcelona from
October 19-21, 2011, on the
theme of “Rethinking Medi-
terranean Security in the
Wake of the Revolutions,”
and was organized in coop-
eration with the Patronat
Catalunya Món. The debate
engaged leading observers
from Egypt, Morocco,
Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya
and considered the effect of
the ongoing revolutions in
the Middle East and North
Africa on the domestic and
regional security equation,
including questions of food
security, human security in
light of migration, and the
special challenges facing
Mediterranean cities. The
activities of the Mediter-
ranean policy program are
completed in partnership
with the Compagnia di San
Paolo, OCP Foundation,

wider atlantic program
For the last 50 years,
at least, the center
of gravity in transatlantic
relations has been firmly
rooted in the Northern
Hemisphere. But the next
decade is likely to bring
a significant rebalancing
within the Atlantic space,
with southern Atlantic part-
ners, including Brazil and
Southern and West Africa,
playing a larger role. In
partnership with Morocco’s
OCP Foundation, GMF
runs the Wider Atlantic
Program, which promotes
dialogue, analysis, and
cooperation in the Atlantic
basin as a whole, north
and south, including Latin
America and Africa.
Research within the
program in 2011 has
produced major new studies
on Morocco’s new geopoli-
tics, energy in the Atlantic
basin, and food security
from the Atlantic perspec-
tive. Studies on Atlantic
cities and regions, new
actors in the Atlantic, and
maritime policy challenges
are underway in 2012.
Also coming in 2012 is a
major new conference, The
Atlantic Dialogues, modeled
on Brussels Forum. This
effort allows GMF to extend
its convening, networking,
and research to Brazil,
Morocco, South Africa,
and other emerging actors
around the Atlantic basin.
cities in transition
In 2011, the Urban
and Regional Policy
Program conducted the
second year of its three-
year Cities in Transition
initiative, which links city
officials, foundation leaders,
community developers, and
other civic leaders from
Detroit, Flint, Cleveland,
Youngstown, and Pittsburgh
with their counterparts in
older industrial cities in
Europe. Following up on
a 2010 study tour, GMF
convened high-level officials
in Youngstown, Ohio, in
June 2011 to discuss strate-
gies for linking economic
and community develop-
ment in the implementa-
tion of the city’s lauded
Youngstown 2010 plan.
In September 2011, GMF
brought together delegates
from all five cities, as well
as representatives from the
White House and the U.S.
Department of Housing
and Urban Development,
to travel to Germany’s Ruhr
Valley to examine strate-
gies for promoting regional
economic cooperation. The
group then spent several
intensive days in Barcelona,
delving more deeply into
a place-based economic
development project, the
22@Barcelona district.
The Cities in Transition
Initiative is completed in
partnership with the Kresge
Foundation, the Surdna
Foundation, and the George
Gund Foundation.

detroit-torino partnership
From July 18-22,
2011, as part of the
Detroit-Torino Partnership
sponsored by the Kresge
Foundation, GMF led the
second of a series of study
tours that bring civic leaders
from Detroit, Michigan, to
Turin, Italy. The delegation
featured high-level busi-
ness and non-profit leaders
and policymakers who
are working to develop a
network of urban markets
in Detroit. Working closely
with the Compagnia di San
Paolo, the City of Turin,
and Torino Internazionale,
GMF crafted a study tour
to examine Turin’s thriving
network of urban markets
in order to understand
what goods and services are
offered, how they operate,
their impact on the regional
economy and society, and
how they are regulated.
GMF, in conjunction with
the study tour participants
and the Kresge Foundation,
are now working to adapt
some of the lessons of Turin
to the Detroit context.
trilateral strategy group
The fourth meeting of
the Trilateral Strategy
Group convened in Istanbul
from May 25-27, 2011,
under the general theme
of “Trilateral Perspectives
on Power and Prosperity,”
and featured in-depth
discussions on global
demographics, migration
and integration, emerging
powers and global gover-
nance, and the sweeping
changes in Turkey’s neigh-
borhood.
The fifth meeting of the
group, titled “Geopolitics
and Strategy in Revolu-
tionary Times,” was held in
Warsaw, Poland, during the
rotating Polish Presidency
of the European Union
Council, from November
13-15, 2011. It included
sessions on the revolutions
in North Africa and the
Middle East, new strategic
games in Eurasia, the role of
civil society organizations
and new social networks in
revolutions and transitions,
and trilateral perspectives
on global “wild cards.”
The twice-annual dialogue
is conducted in partnership
with the Swedish Ministry
for Foreign Affairs, the
Turkish Businessmen’s and
Industrialists’ Associa-
tion, and Koç Holding. The
aim is to bring public- and
private-sector leaders from
Turkey, the United States,
and Europe together for
two days of debate on issues
affecting all sides of the
triangle — “a dialogue with
Turks, but not just about
Turkey.” The meetings host
40-50 participants, and
rotate between Turkish,
European, and U.S. venues.

urban and regional policy program
In 2011, GMF announced that its Comparative Domestic Policy Program would
be relaunched as the Urban and Regional Policy Program. In the years since the
Comparative Domestic Policy Program was created, GMF built a broad, transatlantic
network of local leaders with a particular focus on urban and regional policies that
promote economic vitality, environmental sustainability, affordability, and social inclu-
sion at the local level. In future years, the program’s intention is to become more deeply
involved not just in fostering connections between local policymakers on both sides of the
Atlantic, but also in conducting relevant urban policy analysis and developing program-
ming that brings this analysis to bear on the practical and pressing problems faced by
practitioners at the local level in the United States and Europe. The program took key
steps in this direction in 2011, for example, by hosting a high-level convening of mayors
and other city leaders on the municipal financial crisis, perhaps the most pressing issue
facing cities today. The program develops analytical research on these and other urban
issues, and works with a number of Fellows including:
•	 Nat Bottigheimer
Assistant General Manager, WMATA
•	 Rex Burkholder
Councilor, Portland Metro
•	 Frank Fernandez
Executive Director, Green Doors
•	 Denver Igarta
Urban Planner, City of Portland
•	 Carol Kuester
Principal Planning Coordinator, Bay Area Metropolitan Transportation Commission
•	 Thomas Straatemeier
Senior Advisor for Transportation and Land Use, Goudappel Coffeng
•	 Steve Wertheim
Urban Planner, City of San Francisco
As the Urban and Regional Policy Program renews its focus on those challenges and
policy areas that are central to the strength and vitality of cities on both sides of the
Atlantic, the program’s new name more accurately reflects its focus and expertise, as well
as its vision for the coming years.

2011, in Kronberg, Frank-
furt, and Berlin, Germany,
with 13 members of the
German Bundestag and
seven members of the
U.S. House of Representa-
tives. The program began
in Berlin with a luncheon
hosted by U.S. Ambas-
sador to Germany Philip
Murphy, and was followed
by meetings with senior
officials in the Ministry of
Defense, Chancellery, and
Federal Foreign Office. The
delegation met with busi-
ness leaders and attended
a reception given by the
mayor of Frankfurt. Round-
table discussions in Kron-
berg focused on a variety of
topics, including diplomacy
with Iran, the euro crisis,
India’s role in a multipolar
world, and bridging cultural
divides using technology.
crisis in the eurozone:
transatlantic implications
As the European
sovereign debt
crisis continued to occupy
headlines on both sides of
the Atlantic, the Economic
Policy Program hosted
a number of European
policymakers and experts
for roundtable discus-
sions and public events in
Washington, DC. High-
lighting different aspects
and viewpoints on the
eurozone crisis, GMF
hosted events that featured,
among others, German
Deputy Finance Minister
Steffen Kampeter, Latvian
Finance Minister Andris
Vilks, Governor of the Bank
of Latvia Ilmars Rimse-
vics, and representatives
of the European Central
Bank, as well as Member
of the European Parlia-
ment Reinhard Bütikofer.
In December 2011, GMF,
in cooperation with the
German Federal Foreign
Office, organized a “Euro
Crisis Expert Seminar”
that brought a group of
German financial and
economic experts to the
United States for meetings
and discussions on the
subject of “decoding the
German eurozone debate.”
This programming was
complemented by several
analytical pieces on the
eurozone crisis by GMF
staff and Fellows. In
addition, GMF Senior
Transatlantic Fellow Bruce
Stokes testified in front of
several committees of the
U.S. Congress, and GMF
co-organized several brief-
ings with GMF staff and
Fellows for Congressional
staff on the euro crisis.

immigration events series
In 2011, the Immigra-
tion and Integration
Program continued two
event series in Washington,
DC, and Berlin focused on
key aspects of the broader
immigration and integra-
tion debate. The series in
Washington, “Taking the
Immigration Debate Across
Borders: GMF Embassy
Event Series,” is conducted
in cooperation with select
embassies in Washington.
The Berlin series, GMF’s
“Immigration Round-
tables: A View from Berlin,”
convenes a regular group of
participants to strengthen
relations with the immi-
gration community on the
ground.
Embassy Events in 2011
were held with the Spanish
and German embassies with
speakers such as Spain’s
State Secretary for Immi-
gration and Emigration,
Anna Terron i Cusi; Dr.
Ralf Brauksiepe, Parliamen-
tary State Secretary in the
German Federal Ministry
of Labor and Social Affairs;
and Betsey Stevenson,
Chief Economist at the
U.S. Department of Labor.
Discussions touched upon
the topics of circular migra-
tion and impacts on inte-
gration in Spain and labor
migration in Germany.
Berlin Immigration Round-
tables in 2011 were held
on “New Approaches to
Muslim Engagement”
featuring Farah Pandith,
Special Representative to
Muslim Communities for
the U.S. Department of
State, and on the birthright
citizenship debate in the
United States featuring
Angela Kelley, Center for
America Progress.
Additionally, in September
2011, the Black Sea Trust
and the immigration
program partnered with the
German Embassy in Bucha-
rest on “Migration within
and to the EU” discussing
the need for a coherent EU
migration policy. A round-
table was held in Brussels in
November on “Transatlantic
Approaches to Promoting
Immigrant Belonging,” and
in December 2011, GMF
hosted a discussion on “The
Experience of Muslims
in Europe and the U.S.:
How have Germany and
the U.S. Fared in Inte-
grating Minority Religious
Groups?”
hosting transatlantic leaders
Throughout 2011,
GMF facilitated policy

warsaw office opens
On May 27, 2011, GMF opened an office in Warsaw,
Poland, marking the organization’s seventh in Europe.
GMF is the first U.S. public policy institution to establish
a permanent center in Poland, giving the organization a
competitive edge in this dynamic and increasingly influential
country. GMF has a long history of engagement with Poland,
including grants to Polish organizations since 1990, the
participation of many distinguished Poles in GMF’s Marshall
Memorial Fellowship Program and other programming such
as Brussels Forum, and Poland being a key country in the
annual Transatlantic Trends survey.
The office serves as a forum and source of ideas for
strengthening transatlantic cooperation, with a particular
focus on issues critical to Poland and Central Europe. Led
by Andrew A. Michta, the Warsaw office concentrates
on U.S.-European relations, Central and Eastern Europe,
transatlantic security issues, the EU’s Eastern Partnership,
and energy.
Specifically, the Warsaw office has begun a series of policy
dialogues on the role that shale gas deposits can play in Poland’s energy security. These
dialogues involve energy companies, Polish government officials, and GMF’s in-house
experts. In the area of hard security cooperation, the office held a half-day conference on
“Defense Spending in the Era of Economic Crisis” featuring, among others, Polish Foreign
Minister Radek Sikorski, the Chief of the General Staff
Gen. Mieczysław Cieniuch, and U.S. Ambassador to Poland
Lee Feinstein. The office also organized, in close coopera-
tion with GMF’s Berlin and Bucharest offices, a number
of public discussions and off-the-record meetings with a
particular focus on transatlantic policy initiatives toward
Belarus and Ukraine. In the coming year, the focus of the
Warsaw office will be the development of research projects
to strengthen the political and economic ties between the
United States and Central Europe.

2011 annual report 19
On September 9, GMF’s
Urban Program hosted a
summit on local leadership
and innovation during the
financial crisis, at which
leaders from both sides of
the Atlantic discussed how
their cities are responding
to the effects of the global
recession. Over 60 policy-
makers and practitioners
from the United States and
Europe attended the event,
which was co-sponsored by
the Urban Land Institute.
On October 11, the leader of
the Ukrainian Democratic
Alliance for Reform, Vitali
Klitschko, also the WBC
heavyweight champion,
spoke of the Ukrainian
perspective of Europe in
GMF’s Washington, DC,
office. Klitschko champi-
oned the democratic voice
of opposition and declared
that Ukraine ultimately
desires to join the EU and
integrate its policies.
GMF and the German
embassy hosted a round-
table discussion on October
18 on “Identifying the
Future of Transatlantic
Cooperation on Climate
and Energy,” supported by
the Transatlantic Climate
Bridge initiative of the
German government. The
event fostered a discus-
sion of the most promising
ways that Europe and the
United States could advance
action on climate change,
both domestically and
in collaboration, in the
light of evolving political
conditions and priorities.
Approximately 35 people
helped make progress
toward defining a new set
of priorities for coopera-
tion that will be communi-
cated to funders and policy
leaders on both sides of the
Atlantic.
GMF’s Washington, DC,
office hosted a roundtable
discussion on October
28, on the EU’s Eastern
Partnership with Jerzy
Pomianowski, Undersec-
retary of State at the Polish
Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The minister focused on
Poland’s relationship with
its neighbors, Ukraine and
Belarus, who are planning
to build nuclear plants,
in the context of energy
security. The conclusion: the
language of discourse on
energy security policy will
change as European soli-
darity increases.
In addition, GMF’s Asia
Program hosted leaders
on Asia-Pacific affairs
throughout the year in
meetings with transatlantic
policymakers in both Wash-
ington, DC, and Brussels.
These included Afghan
Ambassador to the United
States Eklil Ahmad Hakimi;
Principal Deputy Assistant
Secretary of State Geoffrey
Pyatt; Deputy Assistant

transatlantic academy
The Transatlantic
Academy serves as
a forum for a select group
of scholars from both
sides of the Atlantic, and
from different academic
and policy disciplines, to
examine a single set of
issues. Working together
from a transatlantic and
interdisciplinary perspec-
tive, Academy Fellows use
research, publications, and
seminars to make policy-
relevant contributions to
transatlantic debates.
In June 2011, the Trans-
atlantic Academy spent
a week traveling through
Europe to launch the
Academy’s report Global
Shift: How the West Should
Respond to the Rise of China.
Written collaboratively by
the 2010-2011 Transatlantic
Academy Fellows, Global
Shift argues that Atlantic
renewal is essential to safe-
guarding stability in global
governance in the coming
era. The Fellows spent 10
months collaborating on
this report and took study
trips to China and South
Korea.
The theme for the fourth
academic year (2011-2012)
is “Natural Resources:
The New Geopolitical
Great Game?” Throughout
the year, the Academy is
focusing on the nexus of
different resources including
energy, water, food, land,
and minerals and exploring
how these challenges
affect social, political, and
economic institutions.
The fourth class of Fellows
includes:
•	 Philip Andrews-Speed,
Chatham House
•	 Raimund Bleischwitz, the
Wuppertal Institute
•	 Geoffrey Kemp, the
Center for the National
Interest
•	 Stacy Van Deveer, Univer-
sity of New Hampshire
•	 Tim Boersma, Groningen
University
•	 Corey Johnson, Univer-
sity of North Carolina,
Greensboro
The Fellows participated in a
study tour to London, Oslo,
and Germany in October
2011 to meet with organiza-
tions doing similar work on
natural resources and gain a
deeper understanding of the
resource nexus. The Fellows
will continue to organize
events throughout the
winter and spring on topics
ranging from the Arctic to
resource security. In May
and June 2012, the Academy
will spend three weeks
in residence at the Bosch
Academy in Berlin.
The Transatlantic Academy
is supported by GMF, the
ZEIT-Stiftung Ebelin und
Gerd Bucerius, the Robert
Bosch Stiftung, the Lynde
and Harry Bradley Founda-
tion, and the Fritz Thyssen
Stiftung. The Academy also

transatlantic trends
The 10th
annual Trans-
atlantic Trends survey
revealed that Americans
may be turning their focus
away from Europe, as a
majority of U.S. respondents
said that their national
interests lie more with the
countries of Asia than with
the European Union.
Transatlantic Trends 2011
is a comprehensive annual
survey of American and
European public opinion in
the United States, Turkey,
and 12 European Union
member states: Bulgaria,
France, Germany, Italy,
the Netherlands, Poland,
Portugal, Romania,
Slovakia, Spain, Sweden,
and the United Kingdom.
The survey is a project of
GMF and the Compagnia
di San Paolo, with addi-
tional support from the
Fundação Luso-Americana,
Fundación BBVA, the
Communitas Foundation,
and the Swedish Ministry
for Foreign Affairs.
Transatlantic Trends 2011
shows that a slight majority
of Americans (51%) feel
that Asian countries, such
as China, Japan, or South
Korea, were more important
to their country’s national
interests than were the
countries of the EU (38%).
Other key findings include:
•	 A generation gap has
emerged among Ameri-
cans with regard to China.
Close to three-in-five
(59%) Americans between
the ages of 18-24 had
a favorable opinion of
China, but that favorable
opinion was only shared
by 33% of the 45-54 age
group.
•	 Only 40% of respondents
in eurozone countries
felt the euro had been
good for their country’s
economy.
•	 For the first time, a
majority of Americans
(56%) were pessimistic
about the prospects of
stabilizing the situation in
Afghanistan, and Euro-
pean pessimism remained
high (66%).

European Council. For the
first time, American leaders
were included in order to
offer a comparative analysis

their respective publics. A
number of specific issues
proved to be divisive for
leaders and their publics,
including the rising powers

transatlantic trends: immigration
The 2011 Transatlantic
Trends: Immigra-
tion survey showed that
in the midst of the global
economic crisis and Arab
Spring, attitudes toward
immigration remain stable
in the United States and
five European countries.
According to the survey,
slight majorities of Ameri-
cans (53%) and Europeans
(52%) see immigration as
a problem, yet they remain
optimistic about immigrant
integration. The survey
also shows that while most
disapprove of government
management of immigra-
tion, a majority of Ameri-
cans and Europeans support
centralized immigration
policies over local ones.
According to this fourth-
annual survey of public
opinion in the United States
and five European coun-
tries (France, Germany,
Italy, Spain, and the United
Kingdom), most also
maintain a negative view of
government management
of immigration, with 68%
of Europeans and 73% of
Americans believing that
their government is doing
a poor or very poor job.
Nevertheless, most Ameri-
cans (56%) and Europeans
(52%) remain optimistic
about immigrant integra-
tion, and majorities are
interested in letting in more
highly educated immigrants.
The survey is a project of
GMF, the Compagnia di
San Paolo, and the Barrow
Cadbury Trust, with addi-
tional support from the
Fundación BBVA.
Other key findings include:
•	 Support for an EU
responsibility to set
national-level immigra-
tion numbers increased to
42% in 2011, though the
Southern European coun-
tries still show far greater
interest than other parts
of Europe.
•	 Strong majorities in
all countries polled in
Europe supported Euro-
pean burden-sharing on
the North African migra-
tion crisis, with 80% of
respondents agreeing that
responsibility should be
shared by all countries in
the EU rather than by the
country where migrants
first arrive. The lowest
support was expressed in
the U.K. (68%), and the
highest support was found
in Italy (88%).
•	 As in previous years,
Americans and Europeans
largely overestimated
the percentage share of
immigrants in their coun-
tries. British respondents,
on average, estimated
a foreign-born popula-
tion of 31.8%, while just
11.3% of the population
is actually foreign born.
Americans, on average,
estimated a foreign-born
population of 37.8%, and
the actual foreign-born
population is only 12.5%.

global swing states
The Global Swing States
Project is a new joint
initiative of GMF and the
Center for a New Amer-
ican Security, currently
supported by the Swedish
Ministry for Foreign Affairs.
The project focuses on four
rising democratic powers
— Brazil, India, Indonesia,
and Turkey — that have
yet to decide whether to
bolster, overturn, or ignore
the prevailing international
order. The project involves
working group meetings in
Washington, DC, commis-
sioned papers, and study
tours, and will culminate
in a final report to be
published in the fall of 2012
that will develop recom-
mendations for how the
United States and Europe
can more effectively engage
with rising democratic
powers in the long-term
objective of strengthening
the rules-based global order.
transformational partnerships in
food security in africa
Continuing its work
on transatlantic food
security policies in the
developing world, GMF
launched Transformational
Partnerships in Food Secu-
rity in Africa: A Transat-
lantic Experts Group in July
2011 in partnership with the
William and Flora Hewlett
Foundation and the Swedish
International Development
Cooperation Agency. The
group, co-chaired by GMF
Senior Fellows Jim Kolbe
and Jean-Michel Severino,
consists of over 40 experts
in food security and agri-
culture. Through intensive
brainstorming sessions
in the United States and
Europe as well as on-the-
ground work in sub-Saharan
Africa, the group will make
targeted policy recom-
mendations in the spring
of 2012. In a time of budget
austerity and increasing
concern about global access
to food, the group’s recom-
mendations will help trans-
atlantic governments and
other stakeholders make the
most of limited develop-
ment resources in order to
promote food security.

sustainability, the role of
the G20, and the future of
the Middle East and North
Africa in light of the Arab
Spring. From September
9–11, 2011, GMF and a
Chicago committee of
MMF alumni hosted the
Marshall Forum on Trans-
atlantic Affairs in Chicago,
Illinois with additional
support from the Chicago
Community Trust. The
theme of the conference,
“Make No Little Plans,”
was woven throughout the
panel sessions and keynote
speeches, which covered a
range of topics including
politics, science, education,
immigration, energy, and
transportation. Keynote
speakers included Sen.
Richard Durbin (D-IL);
Roser Clavell I Soldevila,
secretary general of the
Patronat Catalunya Món;
and Chris Kennedy, chair
of the University of Illinois
Board of Trustees. The
conference included more
than 100 participants and a
broad range of speakers and
panelists from inside the
MMF network and beyond.

asmus policy entrepreneurs
In December 2011,
the German Marshall
Fund announced the launch
of the Asmus Policy Entre-
preneurs Fellowship. In
2012, two young leaders
will be selected to complete
a proposed project that
addresses an important
foreign or economic policy
issue and advances trans-
atlantic cooperation. The
Fellowship is in honor of
Ronald D. Asmus, former
GMF Brussels office execu-
tive director and director
of strategic planning, who
dedicated his life to the
principles of freedom and
passed away on April 30,
2011.
transatlantic cities network
The Transatlantic Cities
Network (TCN)
is an initiative of GMF’s
Urban and Regional Policy
Program that supports the
exchange of information
about innovative policies,
best practices, and local
policy challenges among a
select network of policy-
makers, practitioners, and
civic leaders representing
23 cities in the United States
and Europe. The TCN is
made possible through
partnerships with the
Compagnia di San Paolo
and the Bank of America
Foundation.
transatlantic
cities network
annual meeting
In October 2011, GMF
hosted the annual meeting
of TCN members in Austin,
Texas. Through a series of
site visits and meetings with
city and civic leaders, TCN
representatives examined
Austin’s evolution from
sleepy college town into
a high-tech hub. TCN
members also explored the
impact of Austin’s boom
economy on its less fortu-
nate citizens, with a tour of
low-income housing.
working groups
In 2011, in an effort to
increase the policy impact
of the TCN, members orga-
nized themselves into four
working groups focused
on specific policy areas of
interest to the TCN repre-
sentatives. Current working
group themes include
sustainable transporta-
tion, the development of
ecodistricts and innovation
districts at the neighbor-
hood level, and the role of
public-private partnerships
in promoting economic
development. Each working
group is developing its
own projects and products,
ranging from webinar series
to white papers to policy
convening. Highlights thus
far include working group
participation in an interna-
tional ecodistrict conference
in September 2011 and the
launch of an international
bike-sharing summit to be
held in 2012.

congress-bundestag india study tour
In August and September, GMF and the Robert Bosch
Stiftung organized a four-day study tour to India for
members of the U.S. Congress and the German Bundestag.
Modeled after the classic Congress-Bundestag Forum, this
marked the first time that participants traveled together
outside the United States or Germany. Participants included
bipartisan groups from each body. In New Delhi, the delega-
tion met with senior U.S. and German diplomats, leading
experts on India’s economy and foreign relations, senior
Indian government officials — including National Security
Advisor Shivshankar Menon, Deputy Chairman of the Plan-
ning Commission Montek Singh Ahluwalia, and Commerce Minister Anand Sharma
— and more than a dozen Indian members of parliament. In Mumbai, the study tour
included a meeting with industrialists and business leaders on issues such as financial
regulation, the automobile industry, agriculture, and urbanization. The group also made a
site visit to Dharavi, one of Mumbai’s largest slums, where they saw housing and sanitation
initiatives undertaken by local NGOs.
ronald d. asmus freedom
journalism contest
The Ronald D. Asmus
Freedom Journalism
Contest was created through
a partnership between the
Embassy of the Republic of
Poland in Washington, DC,
and the German Marshall
Fund of the United States.
The contest promoted U.S.
graduate and undergraduate
journalism students’ aware-
ness of international affairs,
particularly in connection
with democracy promo-
tion and human rights.
Reporting on the topic of
democracy promotion in
Belarus, Victoria Cook,
from Johns Hopkins Univer-
sity, won the grand prize in
the print category for her
essay “Stand and Applaud:
The Courage of Belarus’
Revolution via Social
Networks.” Malgorzata

balkan trust for democracy
The Balkan Trust for
Democracy (BTD),
an award-winning public-
private partnership, was
established in 2003 by GMF,
USAID, and the Charles
Stewart Mott Founda-
tion. BTD is structured to
allow both European and
U.S. partners to join the
effort to strengthen trans-
atlantic cooperation in the
Balkans. Since its founding,
additional contributions
from the Embassy of the
Kingdom of the Netherlands
in Belgrade, Compagnia
di San Paolo, Ministry
of Foreign Affairs of the
Czech Republic, Ministry of
Foreign Affairs of Denmark,
Ministry of Foreign Affairs
of Greece, Robert Bosch
Stiftung, Rockefeller
Brothers Fund, Swedish
International Development
Cooperation Agency, and
Tipping Point Founda-
tion have made BTD a true
transatlantic partnership.
In 2011, BTD awarded
more than $3 million in 122
grants to support democ-
racy, good governance, and
Euroatlantic integration
throughout Southeastern
Europe. In addition to
grantmaking, BTD continu-
ally works to accelerate the
region’s integration into
Euroatlantic structures and
build consensus on Balkan
issues from a broader, multi-
stakeholder perspective.
In one example of a BTD
grant in 2011, the Mozaik
Foundation received BTD
support to implement a
project to establish Youth
Banks in five municipalities
of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Each Youth Bank was led by
ten people between the ages
of 15 and 30 years who were
responsible for allocating
micro-grants to local initia-
tives. A total of 40 youth-led
projects were chosen for
support, such as improving
sports facilities or play-
grounds, creating youth
gathering spaces, strength-
ening cultural life through
performances and concerts,
and promoting issues in
ecology and environmental
protection. Significantly, the
amount of BTD’s support
was matched by munici-
palities, which allocated
amounts in their budgets to
support nonformal groups
in their rural community.
The Independent News
Center, a network of local
radio stations based in
Pristina with the support
of Kosovo radio stations,
produced and broadcast
weekly radio shows entitled
“The Bridge: Pristina-
Belgrade Civil Dialogue”
through a BTD grant.
The shows are available
through broadcasters across
Kosovo and Serbia, allowing
communities to listen, in
their own language, to
serious talks attempting to
improve relations between
the two countries.

black sea trust for regional
cooperation
Since 2007, the Black
Sea Trust for Regional
Cooperation (BST) has
awarded more than 280
grants totaling over
$8 million to local and
national NGOs, regional
governmental entities,
community groups, policy
institutes, and other insti-
tutions in Armenia, Azer-
baijan, Bulgaria, Georgia,
Moldova, Romania, Russia,
Turkey, and Ukraine.
Operating from Bucharest,
Romania, BST was founded
by GMF, USAID, the
Government of Romania,
the Charles Stewart Mott
Foundation, and the
Ministry of Defence of the
Republic of Latvia. The
Lynde and Harry Bradley
Foundation also contribute
to the activities of the Trust
by supporting study tours in
the region.
BST promotes regional
cooperation and good
governance in the wider
Black Sea region by
awarding grants through
civic participation, cross-
border initiatives, and the
Eastern Links. Starting in
June 2011, BST initiated a
fourth program, “Confi-
dence Building in South
Caucasus,” in cooperation
with the Robert Bosch Stif-
tung. This program supports
initiatives bringing together
citizens of countries and
regions in conflict.
In 2011, BST continued to
promote regional develop-
ment, awarding 57 grants
totaling more than $1.7
million, with the majority
of grants advancing democ-
racy, promoting peace and
security, or promoting the
Black Sea region as a whole.
Efforts supported by BST
to promote regional coop-
eration included the fourth
Black Sea NGO Forum,
an initiative that increases
the level of dialogue and
coordination among NGOs,
as well as strengthen their
advocacy capacity to influ-
ence development strategies
in the Black Sea region.
More than 300 civil society,
government, and interna-
tional organization partici-
pants from throughout
the region and important
actors in the wider Black
Sea region are engaged in
the Forum’s discussions. The
2011 edition of the Black
Sea NGO Forum focused on
vision, strategy, and policy,
hosting dedicated panels on
leadership; lessons learned
from Eastern Europe’s tran-
sition period, democratiza-
tion, regional cooperation;
and the role of think tanks,
as well as plenary sessions
on national and regional
developments.

fund for belarus democracy
The Fund for Belarus
Democracy (FBD)
is GMF’s contribution to
supporting civil society,
independent media, and
democratic change in
“Europe’s last dictatorship.”
Launched in 2005, and
modeled on GMF’s Balkan
Trust for Democracy,
FBD makes much-needed
support available to agents
of democratic change in
Belarus. To date, it has
awarded more than 350
grants totaling nearly
$5 million in support of
Belarusian civil society,
human rights defenders,
community initiatives,
independent culture, and
free media. While the bulk
of FBD support is directed
at the democratic movement
inside of Belarus, some
assistance has also gone
to cross-border initiatives
that make experiences with
democratic change else-
where available to Belarus,
and that also help to raise
awareness of the Belarus
challenge in the West.
In addition to grantmaking,
FBD utilizes the broad range
of expertise, networks,
and policy-oriented work
to advance Belarus’ plight
for democracy. GMF
staff support Belarusian
partners with capacity-
building, advice, and access
to Western audiences.
In-house experts contribute
regularly to transatlantic
policy and public debate
on Belarus, including
analysis and commentary
to members of the world
media. Belarusian demo-
crats present their cause at
GMF-sponsored gatherings
of international leaders and
experts, including Brussels
Forum.
trust for civil society in central
and eastern europe
The Trust for Civil
Society in Central
and Eastern Europe was
launched in 2001 as a 10-
year sinking fund to support
the long-term sustainable
development of civil society
and NGOs in Bulgaria, the
Czech Republic, Hungary,
Poland, Romania, Slovakia,
and Slovenia. Grant recipi-
ents include registered
nonprofit organizations as
well as other formally and
informally organized citizen
coalitions working for the
advancement of the public
good, and representatives
of the media and educa-
tional institutions. The Trust
encourages them to become
efficient and professional
and to expand their constit-
uencies.
The Trust’s main contribu-
tors are the Ford Founda-
tion, Open Society Institute,
Charles Stewart Mott Foun-
dation, GMF, and Rock-
efeller Brothers Fund. To
date, the Trust has awarded
about $60 million in grants
to organizations in the
target countries. The Trust
will formally close opera-
tions at the end of 2012.

Successful transatlantic relations depend on strong partnerships built over time, across
sectors, and between regions of the world. The German Marshall Fund has integrated this
partnership model into its organizational strategy as a means to achieve greater cooperation
between North America, Europe, and other regions. This approach has led to the inclusion in
the transatlantic community and the GMF network of a broad range of individuals — policy-
makers, journalists, nonprofit leaders, and business leaders — and organizations cutting across
the full spectrum of society.
GMF understands the crucial role that partnerships play in affecting and addressing the
concerns facing the transatlantic community. GMF’s goal is to address the fundamental issues
surrounding the North American-European relationship by drawing on an extensive network
of individuals and institutions on both sides of the Atlantic. Through partnering with other
organizations, GMF is able to ensure that its projects, programs, and activities bring a unique
perspective and provide innovative solutions to transatlantic problems rather than recapitu-
late existing work. GMF actively seeks forward-looking solutions and partners to develop a
sustainable, effective transatlantic community.
GMF pursues a variety of partnership models, such as developing joint initiatives, undertaking
matching funding projects, providing grants for projects carried out by other institutions and
individuals, developing fully granted programs, and seeking in-kind contributions. GMF is
grateful to all of its partners for their contributions to furthering transatlantic cooperation. A
number of organizations have made financial contributions to GMF’s activities, including:
