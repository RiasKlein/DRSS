A letter froM the chAir 


dear friends of Uncf, 

Although this is the first time i am addressing you as chairman 
of the Uncf board of directors, i have been a member of the 
board for 15 years over those years, i have seen Uncf grow in 
exciting ways today we award more than 10,000 scholarships 
each year—more than five times as many as when i joined the 
board—with a total value of over $90 million, a 16-fold increase 
our gates Millennium scholars Program has graduation rates 

graduating from high school prepared for college coursework and 
college success Uncf has been an active and effective presence 
in the media and in the policy-making and legislative communities, 
making the case for education for all Americans 

there couldn’t be a better time for Uncf’s emergence as both the 
nation’s premiere source of financial, social and academic support 
for students of color and as one of its foremost influencers of 
education policy the country’s need for a better-educated workforce 

of 80-90 percent, much higher than the national graduation rate 
the range of our support has increased as well the Uncf/Merck 
science initiative, for example, has advanced the research and 
careers of more than 500 African Americans in biological science 
and engineering, and the Uncf institute for capacity building, has 
helped Uncf-member institutions become stronger and more 
self-sustaining through technical assistance and implementation 
support in areas such as faculty and curriculum development, 
fund-raising and environmental sustainability 
one of the most important growth areas for Uncf has been the 
expansion of its role as a national advocate for educating students of 
color, from pre-school to and all the way through college to reach 
President obama’s goal of regaining world leadership in college 
education, the country will need to increase the number of students 
and the high priority the obama administration has accorded 
to education make this a time of unprecedented opportunity for 
Uncf and the students and colleges that depend on us 
Uncf is poised to build on its record of success and take 
advantage of these opportunities for the benefit of our students 
and our member colleges and universities how far our reach can 
extend—how many students we can help receive their college 
degrees, how many cutting-edge programs we can launch and 
sustain, how many campuses we can help reach environmental 
sustainability—will depend on your support i hope we can count 
on you during this year as we have in the past 
sincerely, 
William f stasior

A letter froM the President And ceo 


dear friends, 

there’s a revolution starting in American education and Uncf is 
leading the way or maybe it would be more accurate to say that 
American public policy is starting to catch up with what Uncf has 
been saying—and doing—for almost 70 years 

from its founding, Uncf has been making the case that every 
American needs and deserves a college education that idea was 

now comes the hard part Just as Uncf has delivered over 
the years on the promise inherent in “A mind is a terrible thing 
to waste,”® it must lead the country in delivering against the 
President’s pledge to regain world leadership and Uncf’s own 
commitment: to double the number of students graduating from 
Uncf-member colleges and universities by 2020 

these are ambitious—even audacious—goals but i believe that 
we have no choice but to pursue them and meet them We owe it 


not universally accepted when we started reaching out to the 
country through our motto, “A mind is a terrible thing to waste,”® 
and the Ad council-sponsored public service announcement 
campaign that made those words almost universally recognized 
today, Uncf’s longtime mission has become national education 
policy President barack obama has called education the economic 
issue of our time and pledged the country to regain world 
leadership in college graduates U s secretary of education Arne 
duncan has declared that “hbcUs will—and absolutely must— 
play a critical leadership role in meeting this challenge ” And 
today everyone recognizes that before they can get a good college 
education, students need to get a good pre-college education 
to our students, our community, our economy and our country 
Many of you have invested in our next generation by investing in 
Uncf and your names are listed in our “honor roll” of funders 
in this report Please accept our gratitude and, more important, 
the gratitude of the students whose education you have made 
possible each year they depend on Uncf for help in getting a 
college education And Uncf depends on you 
sincerely, 
Michael l lomax, Ph d

8 | UNCF: A NATIONAL CHALLENGE 
Whether the subject is education, the economy or the role of Americans of 
color, our country stands at an intersection—an intersection from which all 
roads lead to Uncf 

in the national media, and in city after city across the country, education 
is in the headlines even in the contentious Washington environment, 
bipartisan support has led to significant increases in federal aid to college 
students and school systems A former colorado school superintendent sits 
in the U s senate education reform has been the signature initiative in the 
administration of new York city Mayor Michael bloomberg the Washington, 
dc mayoral election revolved around reforming that city’s public schools 
editorials and op-ed articles herald breakthroughs in public and public 
charter schools 

there’s a good reason that education has moved near the top of the 
national agenda America faces many economic challenges, and education 
addresses all of them the next generation of doctors, nurses and other 
medical professionals we will all need are grade-school students today 
We need them to get a strong education before college so they can succeed 
in college once they get there the scientists and engineers who will 
develop sustainable solutions to our energy needs will need a rigorous 
academic education that begins on the first day of pre-school and doesn’t 
end until graduation from undergraduate, graduate or professional school 
And the future teachers who will educate our children and grandchildren 
must have deep knowledge about the subjects they will teach and the best 
way to teach them 

demographic trends tell us that a lot of those future health care 
professionals, scientists, engineers and teachers will be people of color 
the U s is well on its way to becoming a country in which people of 
color—African Americans, hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, native 
Americans and others—will outnumber what is now the majority population 
Many will come from low-income families and will need help paying for 
college or will not have received the pre-college education they need in 
order to succeed at college so ability and experience in giving low- and 
moderate-income students of color a good education will be at a premium 

this is Uncf’s moment no national organization can match Uncf’s record 
of preparing young people of color for careers of success and service 
More than 350,000 students have received bachelor’s degrees from Uncfmember 
historically black colleges and universities (hbcUs) no scholarship 
program of its size can match the 80-90 percent graduation rates of the low-
income minority recipients in Uncf’s gates Millennium scholars Program 
the pioneering Uncf/Merck science initiative has produced more than 500 
researchers and professors in the biological sciences And when the national 
science foundation ranked colleges—all colleges—based on the number of 
African American alumni who went on to get doctoral degrees in science and 
engineering, hbcUs took the top eight places, ahead of elite private colleges 
and flagship state universities 

now, more than ever before, the nation needs precisely the capabilities in 
which Uncf excels And more than ever before, Uncf-member institutions, 
scholarships and other programs are aligned with the nation’s needs read

Uncf: eMPoWering Unrestricted PotentiAl 


A teacher in chicago who was able to get her college degree and teaching 
certificate thanks to a last-dollar scholarship from the hbcU she graduated 
from An Atlanta businesswoman who studied business and economics 
in her hbcU’s business administration program An aspiring scientist in 
new Jersey who got her first taste of a career in science through a federal 
program awarded to the college she attended 

What do they all have in common? they all got where they are today thanks 
to a unique Uncf fund, made up of unrestricted donations—contributions 
not tied to a particular program, so that member college leaders can focus 
on their campus’s highest priorities 

Who are the generous benefactors whose unrestricted support enables 
the efforts of each of these 39 colleges to fulfill their unique mission and 
tradition? they are the companies and individuals who buy tickets and 
tables at events like the Maya Angelou Women Who lead luncheon in 
charlotte, the black-tie Mayor’s Masked ball in Atlanta and Uncf’s annual 
anniversary dinner in new York they are the people who support Uncf 
students while they get physically fit at a “Uncf Walk for education” in los 
Angeles, houston or Milwaukee they are the hundreds of thousands who 
contribute in response to letters from Uncf And they are the men and 
women who remember Uncf’s students in their wills 

it may be a $50 on-line gift, $100 for a good time outdoors at a walk, a $500 
dinner ticket or a sizable bequest it all adds up—to millions of dollars each 
year, which is set aside in a special fund and then distributed to Uncfmember 
colleges and universities based on an agreed-upon formula 

some schools use their share of the unrestricted fund to support last-dollar 
scholarships that can make the difference between staying in college and 
dropping out others invest in innovative academic programs that prepare 
their students for cutting-edge careers after graduation And still other 
Uncf-member institutions leverage their share by using it to raise money 
for ambitious initiatives funded by corporations, foundations or the federal 
or state government 

it’s in the best tradition of historically black colleges and universities that 
share a common destination—educating young people—but follow unique 
paths to get there 

the ways they find to help their students and the kinds of programs and 
initiatives they create: unrestricted the amount of good they can do: also 
unrestricted 

the satisfaction that tens of thousands of Uncf supporters get from 
knowing they helped send a student to college? that’s unrestricted too 


Unrestricted donations to Uncf 
support the college education of 
55,000 students every year

stUdents And the nAtion need More 


Uncf is doing More 

the growth and accomplishments of Uncf are historically unprecedented: 
10,000 scholarships awarded each year, including a program with an 80-90 
percent graduation rate More than 350,000 graduates of Uncf-member 
schools the Uncf institute for capacity building—a unique institutional 
self-improvement initiative dedicated to making Uncf member institutions 
better and stronger 

but students need more each year, tens of thousands of promising 
students are forced to delay—or cancel—college plans because the schools 
they attended from pre-school through high school didn’t prepare them for 
college-level coursework or because scholarship funds have run out or 
because no one told them that preparing for college has to start, not during 
junior or senior year of high school, but years before, in middle or even 
elementary school 

the nation needs more as well: more teachers, scientists, engineers and 
doctors—in other words, more college graduates President obama has 

take Uncf’s renowned scholarship program, the gates Millennium 
scholars Program, whose recipients, all low-income students of color, have 
compiled average graduation rates of 80-90 percent 

how do you follow a success like that? by building on it—with the 
Partnership for college completion, a joint effort of the KiPP network of 
charter schools, which gets students on the college track and helps them 
stay there; the corporation for enterprise development (cfed), which will 
help the KiPP students, most of whom come from low- and moderate-
income families, save for college; and Uncf, which will provide financial, 
academic and social support when Pcc students are ready Already, Pcc 
has moved from concept to reality, thanks to a $7 5 million grant from citi 
and the citi foundation 

Uncf is also reaching beyond the boundaries of its programs and 
campuses to answer the president’s challenge and double the numbers, 
taking its case for more—and better—education public Uncf was in 
the forefront, for example, of the broad-based coalition that persuaded 
congress to increase Pell grants, the most important federal program 
for low-income students, an increase that will mean $35 million to 
Uncf students alone, and many times that to low-income students at 
other colleges

Uncf And MercK 
supporting the next generation of American scientists 

Americans and people around the world are living better and longer lives, 
and much of the credit goes to revolutionary “miracle drugs” and the 
research discoveries that led to them but there are many illnesses and 
conditions yet to conquer, including Alzheimer’s disease, Aids and cancer 
And Uncf is playing an important role in bringing cures for these and 
other diseases closer to reality through a ground-breaking partnership with 
Merck, the global pharmaceutical and research firm 

the partnership, the Uncf/Merck science initiative (UMsi), supports the 
development of the next generation of researchers in the biological sciences 
and engineering by giving promising African American scientists support 
for their studies and research projects at the undergraduate, graduate and 
post-doctoral levels since UMsi was founded 15 years ago, more than 
500 promising scientists have moved through the program and gone on to 
advanced degrees and careers as academic or pharmaceutical industry 
researchers and as college professors UMsi alumni include: 

• Dr. Donnie Eddins, an alumnus of Uncf-member institution talladega 
college, one of only two scholars to receive Merck fellowships at all three 
levels now a research scientist at Merck, dr eddins’ work focuses on how 
• Dr. Danielle Gray-Singh, who has received two UMsi fellowships, graduated 
from one Uncf-member institution and is now giving back as a leader at 
another dr gray-singh graduated from Uncf-member institution Xavier 
University in new orleans she received her first UMsi fellowship to support 
her research for her Ph d dissertation at tulane University and her second 
for post-doctoral work at baylor college of Medicine she has taught at 
emory University, where she was instrumental in setting up their post-
baccalaureate program, and at Princeton, where she was assistant dean of 
academic affairs and diversity she is now chair of the biology department 
at Uncf-member institution tuskegee University 
• Dr. Milton Brown, an alumnus of the University of Alabama-birmingham, 
and the holder of both Ph d and M d degrees, established georgetown 
University Medical center’s drug discovery Program, whose mission is to 
develop lifesaving diagnostics and therapeutics through drug discovery 
and development 
but the impact of the Uncf/Merck program doesn’t stop there UMsi alumni 
have formed the Association of Uncf/Merck fellows (AUMf) through AUMf, 
they provide scientific and mentoring support for current UMsi fellows and for 

to improve the mental functions of patients with dementia and Alzheimer’s 
disease in 2010, dr eddins received Uncf’s “ones to Watch” award, given 
to alumni of Uncf colleges who have impressive records of achievement 
early in their careers; he was introduced at the awards ceremony by 
shekeila baccus, a student at Uncf-member institution Morris college 
and a new Merck undergraduate fellow whom dr eddins is mentoring 
high school and college students, encouraging their scientific ambitions and 
aspirations and multiplying the impact of the Uncf/Merck science initiative 
far beyond even the large circle of UMsi alumni

Uncf’s gAtes MillenniUM scholArs ProgrAM 
A Model of success for thousands of students—and the nation 

the atmosphere was tense last spring in the auditorium of Washington, 
dc’s benjamin banneker high school, where an assembly of students 
waited to find out which of them had been chosen to receive good-throughgraduation 
scholarships from Uncf’s gates Millennium scholars Program 

their eagerness was understandable recipients of gates Millennium 
scholarships know that in addition to the scholarship checks they will 
receive from Uncf, they will get academic support, mentoring and 
leadership training through college graduation and, in some cases, 
graduate or professional education it’s a formula for success: the 
14,000 low-income students of color who have received gates Millennium 
scholarships in the program’s first decade have an average graduation 
rate of 80-90 percent, almost double the overall college graduation rates of 
students across the entire U s and comparable to the graduation rates of 
students from higher-income families 

the gates Millennium scholars formula—the idea that a scholarship has 
to be more than a check—and its record of success have attracted the 
attention of philanthropists and Washington policy makers alike like the 
rest of the country, they’re looking for a model that will produce the millions 
of additional college graduates the country needs, many of whom will 
need to come from among young Americans of color, as a model for how 
the country can meet President’s obama’s commitment to regain world 
leadership in college education 

the scene at Washington’s banneker high was played out in hundreds of 
other high schools and homes around the country, where high-achieving 
students waited to see if they would be among the 1,000 new gates 
Millennium scholars finally the envelopes were opened, the names were 
announced, and happy students received their award packages while proud 
parents and teachers beamed and classmates applauded they were close 
to the end of their high school careers and on the brink of a lifetime of 
learning, leadership and service

Uncf has Answers 

A new study by Uncf’s frederick d Patterson research institute carries an 
encouraging message for families pinched by recession-limited resources 
and increasing tuition: Uncf-member colleges and universities are more 
than 30 percent less expensive than comparable institutions 

At a time when a college education is more important than ever, the cost 
of getting a college education—tuition and fees, books, dormitory rooms, 
meals and activity fees—keeps getting higher but government statistics 
show that family income levels are flat As the recession lingers, some 

undergraduate degree 

less than tuitions at comparable institutions nine Uncf-member 
institutions did not raise their tuition and fees at all during the two-year 
period of the study, while one Uncf-member institution actually reduced 
its tuition and fees All comparable non-Uncf institutions in the survey 
increased tuition and fees by an average of $1,700 over the same period 

the Patterson institute, named for Uncf’s founder, was re-launched this 
year its mandate: to conduct the rigorous research that Uncf and its 
member colleges need to pinpoint the needs of colleges and students,

to serve A nAtion 
national recognition for the tradition of service at hbcUs 

from dr Martin luther King, Jr , to brown University President ruth 
simmons to U s surgeon general regina benjamin—all graduates of 
Uncf-member institutions—the importance of service has always been a 
critical part of what hbcUs have taught their students 

service has also been a key theme in the short videos on Uncf activities that 
punctuate UNCF An Evening of Stars® viewers of last year’s tribute to lionel 
richie saw students at spelman college cooperate with team members from 
presenting sponsor target to work with youngsters at spelman’s on–campus 
child care center, part of the college’s laboratory school And during the 
previous year’s UNCF An Evening of Stars® tribute to Patti labelle, viewers 
watched as target President of community relations laysha Ward and a 
team of target associates worked alongside students at Uncf-member 
school huston-tillotson University to repair damage to the campus’s trees 
and shrubbery inflicted by hurricanes Katrina and rita 

now, the commitment to service that has always been a hallmark of Uncfmember 
institutions has received national recognition the Washington 
Monthly’s prestigious ranking of liberal arts colleges has given high 


marks to many Uncf schools Unlike other rankings which are based 
on a measures like selectivity, per-student spending and the opinions of 
academic peers, the Washington Monthly survey evaluates colleges based 
on three factors: social mobility (recruiting and graduating low-income 
students); research (producing cutting-edge scholarship and Ph d s); and 
service (encouraging students to give something back to their country) 

the magazine placed 12 Uncf schools in the top half of its 2009 rankings 
Morehouse college was ranked 14th, ahead of oberlin college spelman 
finished 21st, just ahead of bowdoin and vassar fisk University was ranked 
32nd, dillard University 40th, tougaloo college 42nd and talladega college 
and rust college 52nd and 57th, respectively Uncf institutions Johnson c 
smith University, lane college, Paine college, bennett college for Women 
and Jarvis christian college were also ranked in the top half of the nation’s 
liberal arts colleges 

More than 150 years after the first hbcU was founded, the commitment 
of hbcUs to attracting and graduating students and preparing them for 
careers not only of success but service lives on And in the Washington 
Monthly rankings, that tradition is getting the recognition it deserves .

building green at Minority-serving institutions 

historically black colleges and universities know all about doing more with 
less Any institutions committed to educating students from low-income 
families know how to provide a quality education while getting the most 
out of scarce resources Uncf is building on that foundation of experience 
to help its member colleges and universities make environmental 
sustainability a reality on their campuses through the Uncf building green 
at Minority serving institutions program thanks to support from the Kresge 
foundation, Uncf is leading the way 

the green building initiative is a project of Uncf’s institute for capacity 
building, the unique 10-year, $120 million institutional self-improvement 
program that helps hbcUs become academically and financially stronger 
and more self-sustaining An array of like-minded organizations including 
second nature, the thurgood Marshall college fund, the hispanic 
Association of colleges and Universities and the American indian higher 
education consortium are partnering with Uncf to make the green building 
initiative a success 


in its first year, Uncf’s building green initiative has brought together more 
than 350 representatives of hbcUs and other minority-serving institutions 
with leading experts in college campus environmental sustainability to 
learning institutes in Atlanta, Minneapolis and san Antonio where they traded 
experiences and lessons-learned the program also developed the first 
Msi campus-wide sustainability survey and established an intensive green 
facilities training series the program will award 10 campus climate action 
planning mini-grants to black, tribal and hispanic-serving institutions blazing 
new trails in college-campus sustainability 

the green building initiative concluded its first year to enthusiastic reviews 
dr beverly daniel tatum, president of Uncf-member institution spelman 
college, credited the green building initiative with inspiring the sustainable 
spelman program And howard University, a program participant, credited 
Uncf’s building green initiative with “providing a great service by uniting 
historically black colleges and universities and other minority-serving 
institutions on this issue ” 


Uncf’s building green learning institutes 
attracted leaders and faculty from 104 
minority-serving colleges and universities, 
with a total enrollment of 552,987.

Uncf An evening of stArs® 


Music with a Mission 

the moment singer-songwriter lionel richie stepped onto the UNCF 
An Evening of Stars® stage to receive the program’s annual Award of 
excellence was special—in more ways than one not only because of the 
music-industry icons who had preceded richie over the UNCF An Evening 
of Stars®‘s 32 years not only because richie has written and recorded a 
seemingly endless string of hits, including the iconic humanitarian anthem, 
“We Are the World,” which he co-wrote with Michael Jackson but because, 
as an alumnus of Uncf-member institution tuskegee University, richie 
is a shining example of the ability of Uncf colleges and universities to 
prepare young men and women for careers of success and service 

A galaxy of stars—Akon, Katharine McPhee, Jesse Mccartney, ledisi and 
many more—turned out to perform the songs that richie made famous and 
to tell a sold-out studio audience and millions of viewers around the country 
about Uncf’s work enabling students to attend and graduate from college 
James ingram, natalie cole and erica campbell joined the legendary stevie 
Wonder in a performance of richie and Jackson’s timeless “We Are the 
World ” the program’s emotional climax was a moving tribute to the King 
of Pop, Michael Jackson, a longtime friend of Uncf who endowed a Uncf 
scholarship that has helped almost 300 students attend Uncf colleges and 
universities the tribute was hosted by Uncf President and ceo dr Michael 
lomax and laysha Ward, president of target community relations, and was 
presented by target 

but the undisputed star of the UNCF An Evening of Stars® tribute to lionel 
richie was—who else?—lionel richie he received a standing ovation 
for his performance of three of his most popular songs, “All night long,” 
“hello” and “easy ” And he moved many in the audience to tears with his 
reminiscences of his student days at tuskegee and his heartfelt evocation 
of how what he learned in college enabled him to take command of his own 
career and manage it to his best long-term advantage 

richie’s phenomenally successful career, and all that he has given back to 
his school, his community and the world, speak to the strong beginning he 
had at tuskegee University and to the potential of tuskegee and all Uncfmember 
institutions to give students a foundation to contribute to their 
professions, their communities and to the United states 

the audience for UNCF An 
Evening of Stars® ranks first 
among all nationally syndicated, 
first-run original programs 
and for all African American 
tv households

to stop their education just short of graduation day they’re the students 
whose graduation is threatened by the lingering recession 

it’s the second year in a row that hard economic times have threatened 
to derail Uncf graduating seniors it was spring of last year when, all 
across the Uncf network of colleges and universities, graduating seniors 
struggled to pay their tuition, textbook and housing bills so they could 
receive their diplomas on graduation day they had seen layoffs and pay 
cuts slash family financial help the credit crunch squeezed many private 
student loans off the market And a falling stock market reduced the help 
foundations and corporations could provide 


but Uncf was there to help More than $7 5 million in emergency 
scholarship aid—from longtime Uncf partners like exxonMobil, JPMorgan 
chase, lowe’s and the Andrew Mellon foundation and more from thousands 
of corporate, foundation and individual supporters—enough for more than 
4,000 students to walk across the stage with their classmates and receive 
their college degrees 

some say the recession is ending but unemployment is still high, squeezing 
the resources of students and families and once again threatening seniors’ 
graduation plans And once again, Uncf is committed to giving its seniors 
the help they need to cross the last hurdle to graduation by gathering 
support for the campaign for emergency student Aid 

Will Uncf supporters once again come to the rescue of the seniors the 
nation needs? stay tuned 


4,000 

the campaign for emergency student 
Aid has enabled more than 4,000 Uncfsupported 
seniors to graduate on time

the Uncf hbcU eMPoWer Me toUr 


tapping into the Power of education 


not all the classes students need to get to and through college are listed 
in the college catalog or taught in classrooms sometimes students get 
valuable information and insights outside of school from teachers who 
speak the language that young people understand 

that’s where the Uncf hbcU empower Me tour comes in: a traveling road 
show that provides the knowledge that students need but don’t always get in 
class—life-skill areas like health and wellness, financial education, college 
readiness and entrepreneurship—from experts and celebrities who command 
young people’s attention and respect and from sponsors like Wells fargo, 
fedex, burger King, American cancer society and the U s Army 

now completing its third year on the road with sponsor Wells fargo, the 
Uncf hbcU empower Me tour added new stops to its schedule and new 
experts and celebrities to its lineup in addition to hbcU campuses like 
tuskegee University, clark Atlanta University, hampton University and 
Xavier University, the empower Me tour added stops in cities like chicago, 
los Angeles, Minneapolis and new York 


the tour reaches out to students and families who might not be as familiar 
as their counterparts in hbcU college towns with how important college 
is, what it takes to become college-ready and the educational, cultural, 
financial support and enrichments that hbcUs offer 

At every Uncf hbcU empower Me tour stop, audiences of middle school, 
high school and college students heard success stories like those of 
entrepreneur dr randal Pinkett, talk-show host Warren ballentine, actress 
tatyana Ali and comedian and Zeta Phi beta sorority, inc , President sheryl 
Underwood talk about what college meant to them and how what they 
had learned there empowered them to launch their careers and give back 
to young people and their communities, diversify their business interests 
and overcome race and gender obstacles And they found out how they 
could become part of the empower Me community by sharing their own 
experiences on “empower Me tv,” hosted by Malik Yoba 

Most important, they got a taste of the true breadth and depth of 
education—and how empowering education can be 

More than 15,000 high school and college 

15,000 students have attended empower Me tour stops

To the Board of Directors and Members of United Negro College Fund, Inc., 
Fairfax, Virginia 

We have audited the accompanying statements of financial position of the 
United Negro College Fund, Inc. (Uncf) as of March 31, 2010, and 2009, 
and the related statements of activities, functional expenses and cash flows 
for the years then ended these financial statements are the responsibility 
of Uncf’s management our responsibility is to express an opinion on these 
financial statements based on our audits the prior year’s summarized 
and comparative information has been derived from Uncf’s 2009 financial 
statements and, in our report dated september 21, 2009, we expressed an 
unqualified opinion on those financial statements 

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally 
accepted in the United states of America those standards require that we 
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the financial statements are free of material misstatement An audit includes 
consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for 

designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but 
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Uncf’s 
internal control over financial reporting Accordingly, we express no such 
opinion An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting 
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the 
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, 
as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation We believe 
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion 

in our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in 
all material respects, the financial position of the United Negro College 
Fund, Inc., as of March 31, 2010, and 2009, and the changes in its net assets 
and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting 
principles generally accepted in the United states of America

1. Organization 
the United negro college fund, inc (Uncf) is organized as a not-for-profit 
entity established to assist its 39 current member institutions of higher 
education to raise funds from the public for their mutual support Member 
institutions participate in both the regular and capital campaigns 

All participating member institutions receive distributions of unrestricted 
support and revenues, net of expenses, pursuant to a formula support 
and revenue, net of expenses, raised in accordance with joint campaign 
agreements, is distributed 75 percent to the member institutions conducting 
the campaign the remaining 25 percent is included in the regular campaign 
formula distribution to all member institutions 

in addition, Uncf administers grants, scholarships and other programs 
benefiting students, member institutions and non-member institutions, 
based on donor stipulations 

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Codification — the fAsb 
issued Accounting standards codification (Asc) topic 105, generally 
Accepted Accounting Principles, which became the single source of 
authoritative nongovernmental U s generally accepted accounting principles 
(gAAP) recognized by fAsb the codification is effective for interim or annual 
financial periods ending after september 15, 2009 the accompanying 
financial statements of Uncf include references to the codification 

Basis of Accounting — the accompanying financial statements of Uncf 
are presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted 
in the United states of America and have been prepared on the accrual 
basis of accounting 

Cash and Cash Equivalents — cash and cash equivalents are liquid 
investments with original maturities at the date of purchase of three months 
or less and consist primarily of money market funds and repurchase 
agreements used for overnight investment purposes All other highly liquid 
instruments, which are to be used for the long-term purposes of Uncf, are 
classified as investments cash and cash equivalents are valued at their 
carrying amount which approximates fair value due to their short maturities 

Investments — investments are reported at fair value based on quoted 
market prices or, in the case of alternative investments, at estimated values 
provided by the fund managers or general partners based on quoted market 
prices, if available, or other valuation methods investments classified as 
short-term are available for operations in the next fiscal year the cost 
assigned to investments received by gift is the fair value at the date the gift 
is received Unrealized and realized gains and losses are included in the 
accompanying statements of activities 

investment earnings are reported net of related expenses, such as custodial, 
commission and investment advisory fees such expenses amounted to 
$1,899,631 and $2,308,381 in fiscal years 2010, and 2009, respectively 

Pledges Receivable — Pledges receivable consist primarily of amounts 
due from unconditional promises to give by various donors Unconditional 
promises to give that are expected to be collected in future years are 
recorded at the present value of their estimated future cash flows 
the discounts on those amounts are computed using risk free interest 
rates applicable to the years in which the promises to give are received 
Amortization of the discounts is included in contributions and gifts revenue 

An allowance for uncollectible pledges receivable is provided based on 
management’s judgment, including such factors as prior collection history, 
type of contribution and nature of fund-raising activity At March 31, 2010, 
and 2009, Uncf had an allowance for uncollectible pledges of $262,851 and 

$273,873, respectively 
54 | UNCF: A NATIONAL CHALLENGE 

conditional pledges receivable are not included as support until the 
conditions are substantially met As of March 31, 2010, and 2009, Uncf had 
received conditional promises to give totaling approximately $1,859,000 and 
$633,000, respectively 

Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment — furniture, fixtures, and equipment 
are recorded at cost, or if donated, such assets are capitalized at the 
estimated fair value at the date of receipt depreciation is computed using 
the straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging from three to 
10 years lease-hold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the 
remaining life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvements 

Uncf capitalizes all acquisitions of furniture, fixtures and equipment over 
$2,500 and when assets are sold or disposed of, the cost and corresponding 
accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts 
with any gain or loss recognized currently expenditures for repairs and 
maintenance are charged to expense as incurred 

Capitalized Software — certain costs to develop or obtain internal use 
software are capitalized in accordance with fAsb Asc topic 350-40, 
Accounting for the costs of software for internal Use (previously known as 
statement of Position (soP) no 98-1, Accounting for costs of computer 
software developed or obtained for internal Use) 

Collection Items Acquired on or after April 1, 2008 — Accessions of 
collection items are capitalized at cost, if the items are purchased, or at 
their fair value on the accession date, if the items were contributed gains or 
losses from deaccessions of these items are reflected in the accompanying 
statements of activities as changes in the appropriate net asset classes, 
depending on the existence and type of donor-imposed restrictions 

Distributions to Member Institutions — Uncf accrues expenses due to 
member institutions and, occasionally, non-member institutions of higher 
education up to the amount by which support and collections of pledges, 
including the values attributed to gifts-in-kind, exceeds program, fundraising 
and administrative expenses regular distributions are made 
three times a year and other distributions, such as capital campaign and 
designated gifts, are made on an on-going basis current-year distributions 
may also include amounts from net assets designated for distribution 

Refundable Advances from Donor — refundable advances from donor 
result from contributions received for the gates Millennium scholars 
Program (gMsP) that, based on terms of the agreement, including the 
grantor’s ability to cancel the grant at any time, result in program funds 
being received prior to recognition of the corresponding revenue the 
amounts are recognized as revenue in the period for when the grant 
conditions are met 

Unrestricted Net Assets — Unrestricted net assets consist of undesignated 
and designated net assets and include gifts, grants, investment income or 
other resources where donors have not specified any purpose for which 
such resources are to be used Undesignated net assets are funds that 
are currently available to support Uncf’s daily operations designated net 
assets consist of unrestricted funds designated by the board of directors for 
scholarships and capital projects 

Temporarily Restricted Net Assets — temporarily restricted net assets 
include gifts, grants, investment income or other resources where donors 
have specified the purposes and/or the time for which such resources are 
to be used, generally for capital development and scholarships Accordingly, 
distributions of available resources accrue to member institutions only 
when donor restrictions are met, or in the case of capital campaign receipts, 
when the terms of the campaign program have been met When a time and/ 
or purpose restriction expires or is met, temporarily restricted net assets 
are reclassified to unrestricted net assets and reported in the accompanying 
statements of activities as net assets released from restrictions 

 UNCF: A NATIONAL COMMITMENT | 55 

notes to finAnciAl stAteMents (continued) 


temporarily restricted contributions and gifts whose restrictions expire 
in the same year of receipt are classified as unrestricted revenues in the 
accompanying statements of activities 

Permanently Restricted Net Assets — Permanently restricted net assets 
include gifts and bequests where donors have stipulated that the principal 
be maintained intact these gifts are invested by Uncf’s management 
generally, there have been no permanent restrictions placed upon Uncf’s 
investment earnings however, the majority of the earnings are specified 
by the donors to support scholarships or program development net gains 
with no permanent restrictions and that are not specified by the donors to 
support scholarships or program development may be retained at the board 
of directors’ discretion as reserves for future distribution equalization 

Endowment Net Asset Classifications — in August 2008, fAsb issued 
Asc topic 958-205, reporting endowment funds (previously known as 
staff Position no 117-1, endowments of not-for-Profit organizations: net 
Asset classification of funds subject to an enacted version of the Uniform 
Prudent Management of institutional funds Act and enhanced disclosures 
for All endowment funds) fAsb topic Asc 958-205 provides guidance on 
the net asset classification of donor-restricted endowment funds for a not-
for-profit organization that is subject to an enacted version of the Uniform 
Prudent Management of institutional funds Act (UPMifA) 

Uncf is subject to the state of new York’s UPMifA and has adopted fAsb 
topic Asc 958-205 as of April 1, 2008, as required Uncf has interpreted the 
state of new York’s UPMifA as requiring the preservation of the fair value 
of the original gift as of the gift date of the donor-restricted endowment 
funds absent explicit donor stipulations to the contrary As a result of this 
interpretation, Uncf classifies as permanently restricted net assets (a) 
the original value of gifts donated to the permanent endowment and (b) the 
original value of subsequent gifts to the permanent endowment further, 
during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, Uncf reviewed all endowment 
funds and transferred to temporarily restricted net assets those that are 
subject to UPMifA that were previously classified as unrestricted 

the associated gains and income on donor-restricted endowment funds 
are classified as temporarily restricted net assets until those amounts are 
appropriated for expenditure by Uncf in a manner consistent with the 
standard of prudence prescribed by UPMifA in accordance with UPMifA, 
Uncf considers the following factors in making a determination to 
appropriate or accumulate donor-restricted endowment funds: 

(1) 
the duration and preservation of Uncf 
(2) 
the purposes for which Uncf will appropriate funds from the 
donor-restricted endowment fund 
(3) 
general economic conditions 
(4) 
the possible effect of inflation and deflation 
(5) 
the expected total return from income and the appreciation 
of investments 
(6) 
other resources of Uncf 
(7) 
the investment policies of Uncf 
from time to time, the fair value of assets associated with individual donor-
restricted endowment funds may fall below the level that the donor or 
UPMifA requires Uncf to retain as a fund of perpetual duration Uncf had 
no deficiencies of its restricted net assets at March 31, 2010, and 2009 

Endowment Investment and Spending Policies — endowment assets 
include those assets of donor-restricted funds that Uncf must hold in 
perpetuity or for a donor-specified period Uncf has adopted investment 
and spending polices for endowment assets that attempt to provide a 
predictable stream of funding to programs supported by its endowments 

Preservation of capital is foremost, followed by preservation of purchasing 
power and growth of assets the investment policy establishes an achievable 
return objective through diversification of asset classes the current longterm 
return objective is to attain an average annual real return (net of 
investment and management fees) of five percent above the consumer Price 
index (cPi) it is recognized that the real return objective will be difficult to 
attain in every period, but it should be attainable over the long-term 

56 | UNCF: A NATIONAL CHALLENGE 

to satisfy its long-term rate-of-return objectives, Uncf relies on a total 
return strategy in which investment returns are achieved through both 
capital appreciation (realized and unrealized) and current yield (interest and 
dividends) Uncf targets a diversified asset allocation that places a greater 
emphasis on equity-based investments to achieve its long-term return 
objectives within prudent risk parameters 

Uncf’s fiscal policy governs the use of resources in the various endowed 
funds for program expenses and administrative costs endowment funds 
are used for the specified purposes, or over the specified time period, 
designated by the donors the amount of endowment funds available for 
use is based on the realized and unrealized cumulative investment income 
gains and losses in excess of the respective endowment’s principal balance 
multiplied by five percent of the average three-year market value 

these funds are used, with respect to any endowment restrictions, to 
support new initiatives or new one-time or short-term (two to three years) 
activities, subject to the submission of a business plan that has been 
reviewed and endorsed by executive management and approved by Uncf’s 
board of directors once approval of an initiative or activity is obtained from 
the board of directors, the use of the endowment funds is incorporated 
into the operating budget process and distributions are based on the 
budgeted amounts 

Revenue Recognition — revenue is recognized during the period in which it 
is earned revenue received in advance and not yet earned is deferred to the 
applicable period 

Donated Services — the value of certain services provided to and/or paid on 
behalf of Uncf’s programs that are susceptible to objective measurement or 
valuation have been reflected in the financial statements (see note 17) 

Additionally, a substantial number of volunteers have donated significant 
amounts of time to Uncf’s program services and to its fund-raising 
campaigns Although the value of these services is significant, Uncf does 
not record such value in its financial statements since the criteria for 

recognition is not met in accordance with fAsb Asc topic 958-605-25, 
not-for-Profit entities—revenue recognition (previously known as 
statement of financial Accounting standards (sfAs) no 116, Accounting for 
contributions received and contributions Made) 

Expenses — expenses are recognized by Uncf during the period in which 
they are incurred expenses paid in advance and not yet incurred are 
deferred to the applicable period 

Functional Allocation of Expenses — the costs of providing various 
programs and supporting services have been summarized on a functional 
basis in the accompanying statements of activities Accordingly, certain costs 
have been allocated among the programs and supporting services benefited 

Use of Estimates — the preparation of financial statements in conformity 
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United states of 
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that 
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of 
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and 
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
Actual results could differ from those estimates 

Financial Instruments and Credit Risk — financial instruments which 
potentially subject Uncf to concentrations of credit risk consist principally 
of investments, pledges receivable and certain revenue sources Uncf 
places its investments at creditworthy financial institutions by policy, these 
investments are kept within authorized limits designed to prevent risks 
caused by concentration 

credit risk with respect to pledges receivable is generally limited, except 
as follows, because Uncf deals with a large number of donors and has 
maintained long-term relationships with these donors At March 31, 2010, 
and 2009, approximately 16 percent and 31 percent of pledges receivable, 
respectively, were from a single corporate donor 

 UNCF: A NATIONAL COMMITMENT | 57 

notes to finAnciAl stAteMents (continued) 

there is a concentration of credit risk associated with recognition of 
revenues under the gMsP Approximately 83 percent and 85 percent of 
Uncf’s contributions revenue for scholarship purposes for fiscal years 
2010, and 2009, respectively, was received from the bill & Melinda gates 
foundation based on conditions placed in the restated grant agreement 
with the bill & Melinda gates foundation, funding is not recorded in the 
year received, but rather as a liability (refundable advances from donor) with 
revenue recognized in the year in which the conditions are met At March 31, 
2010, and 2009, refundable advances were $537,299,687 and $590,059,446, 
respectively and related investments totaled $881,468,228 and $846,523,607, 
respectively (also see note 12) 

As of March 31, 2010, Uncf had no other significant concentration of credit 
risk, except as described in note 4 

Fair Value Measurements — Uncf adopted fAsb Asc topic 820, fair value 
Measurements and disclosures (previously known as sfAs no 157, fair 
value Measurements) on April 1, 2008 the adoption did not impact the 
amounts reported in the financial statements, but does require additional 
footnote disclosures about the inputs used to develop the measurements 
of fair value and the effect of certain measurements reported in the 
accompanying statements of activities and as described in note 9 

Reclassification — certain amounts in the 2009 financial statements have 
been reclassified to conform to the 2010 presentation 

Summarized Financial Information for 2009 — the accompanying financial 
statements include certain prior year summarized comparative information 
in total but not by net asset class such information does not include 
sufficient detail to constitute a presentation in conformity with accounting 
principles generally accepted in the United states of America Accordingly, 
such information should be read in conjunction with Uncf’s financial 
statements for the year ended March 31, 2009, from which the summarized 
information was derived 

3. Income Taxes 
Uncf has been granted exemption by the internal revenue service (irs) 
from federal income taxes under section 501(c)(3) of the internal revenue 
code the irs has also determined that Uncf is not a private foundation 
Uncf is required to report and pay taxes on unrelated business income to 
the irs and other local jurisdictions there was no liability for unrelated 
business income taxes as of March 31, 2010, and 2009 

Additionally, on April 1, 2009, Uncf adopted the provisions of fAsb Asc 
topic 740-10, income taxes (previously known as fAsb interpretation no 
48, Accounting for Uncertainty in income taxes) Management believes it 
has no material uncertain tax positions or any related penalties and interest 
to accrue for the year ended March 31, 2010, and, accordingly, there is no 
liability for unrecognized tax benefits 

Uncf files irs form 990 annually with the federal government and is still 
open to examination by taxing authorities for fiscal year 2007 and later 

4. Uninsured Cash Balances 
Uncf places its cash and cash equivalents with high-credit-quality financial 
institutions that are federally insured for $250,000 and for $500,000 under 
the federal depository insurance corporation Act and the securities 
investor Protection corporation (siPc), respectively Amounts held in 
excess of the fdic limits were $9,698,494 and $13,610,548 at March 31, 
2010, and 2009, respectively Amounts held in excess of the siPc limits 
were $9,448,494 and $13,360,548 at March 31, 2010, and 2009, respectively 
Uncf has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not 
exposed to any significant credit risk on its cash and cash equivalents

there are receivables and payables for unsettled trades at March 31, 
2010, and 2009 these investment receivables and payables are reported 
separately in the accompanying statements of financial position 
investments held for long-term purposes include investments for which 
the board of directors and member institutions have earmarked the 
proceeds from the liquidation of such investments to be utilized primarily for 
distribution equalization in low-income years and endowment funds for which 
donors have stipulated that the principal remain intact investments in various 
funds held in fixed income, U s and global equities, hedge funds and private 
equities are valued based on Uncf’s share of net assets in the underlying 
investment portfolios the underlying investment portfolios are valued by the 
respective investment managers at quoted market prices or estimated fair 
values for positions for which there is a limited market Management reviews 
and evaluates the values provided by the fund managers and general partners 
and agrees with the valuation methods and assumptions used in determining 
the fair value of these alternative investments 
due to the inherent uncertainties of these estimates, these values may differ 
from the values that would have been reported had a ready market for such 
investments existed Additionally, Uncf’s hedge fund and private equity 
investments were out of the mandatory lock-up periods Approximately 
$6,700,000 million is in a lock-up of one year or less and approximately 
$4,200,000 is in a lock-up of greater than two years Uncf also has

these investment receivables and payables are reported separately in the 
accompanying statements of financial position 

9. Fair Value Measurements 
the fair market value of a financial instrument is defined in fAsb Asc 
topic 825, financial instruments (previously known as sfAs no 107, 
disclosures about fair value of financial instruments) as “the amount at 
which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between 
willing parties ” 

the carrying amounts reported in the accompanying statements of 
financial position for short-term investments, pledges receivable, accrued 
investment income, accounts payable and accrued expenses and notes 
payable, approximate fair value given the short-term nature of the financial 
instruments or conversely based a non-recurring assessment of fair value 

As indicated in note 2, Uncf adopted fAsb Asc topic 820 on April 1, 2008 
there were no financial instruments for which a retrospective application of 
fair value measurement was required therefore, the effect of adopting the 
provisions of fAsb Asc topic 820 is prospective from the beginning of the year 

the following methods and assumptions were used by Uncf in estimating 
the fair value of other financial instruments, which consist of investments As 
defined in fAsb Asc topic 820, fair value is the price that would be received 
to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement date (exit price) Uncf 
utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in 
pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks 
inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique these inputs can be readily 
observable, market corroborated or generally unobservable Uncf primarily 
applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements and 

endeavors to utilize the best available information Accordingly, Uncf 
utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and 
minimize the use of unobservable inputs Uncf is able to classify fair value 
balances based on the observability of those inputs 

Uncf’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value 
measurements requires judgment and may affect the valuation of fair value 
of assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy 
levels Also, the time between inception and performance of the contract 
may affect the fair value the determination of fair value may, therefore, 
affect the timing of recognition of revenues and change in net assets 

fAsb Asc topic 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that gives the highest 
priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or 
liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to measurements 
involving significant unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements) the three 
levels of fair value hierarchy are as follows: 

Level 1 Inputs: valuation based on quoted prices in active markets for 
identical assets or liabilities that a reporting entity has the ability to access 
at the measurement date and where transactions occur with sufficient 
frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an on-going basis 

Level 2 Inputs: valuation based on inputs other than quoted prices included 
within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly 
or indirectly inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in 
active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities 
in markets that are not active, that is markets in which there are few 
transactions, prices are not current or prices vary substantially over time 

Level 3 Inputs: valuation based on inputs that are unobservable for an asset or 
liability and shall be used to measure fair value to the extent that observable 
inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if 
any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date this input 
therefore reflects Uncf’s assumptions about what market participants would 
use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information

available in the circumstances this classification does not imply a lack of 
liquidity of the investment Uncf has a target allocation of approximately 
eight percent for private equities further, 61 percent of the Uncf long-term 
portfolio has monthly or better liquidity while approximately 32 percent of this 
portfolio has quarterly liquidity Uncf carefully monitors these positions as it 
conducts periodic reviews of both asset allocation and performance

during fiscal year 2009, Uncf received approval from its board of directors 
to secure $3 million in financing to support an investment in a new 
enterprise-wide donor and financial management software system in an 
effort to gain efficiencies in its operating environment Accordingly, expenses 
related to this endeavor were capitalized in accordance with fAsb Asc topic 
350-40 and reflected as construction in process at March 31, 2009 
62 | UNCF: A NATIONAL CHALLENGE 

during fiscal year 2010, the system became largely operational and 
therefore those related capitalized costs amounting to $2,172,966 have been 
transferred to computers and equipment and will be depreciated over the 
assigned three-year life 

depreciation and amortization expense for the years ended March 31, 2010, 
and 2009 was $686,754 and $980,676, respectively 

11. Collections 
Uncf’s collection items amounting to $6,929,250, consisted of donated 
works of art as received from the estate of benny Andrews foundation, inc 
Uncf maintains this art collection within a secure museum setting and will 
distribute the artwork to member colleges and other entities in accordance 
with the donor’s intent An independent appraisal was used to measure the 
fair value at date of gift 

12. Refundable Advances from Donor 
during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2000, Uncf received a grant from 
the bill & Melinda gates foundation (the foundation) for $1 billion over 
a 20-year period or approximately $50 million per year to administer the 
gMsP the purpose of the grant is to provide scholarships, fellowships and 
leadership opportunities for approximately 20,000 outstanding low-income 
African American, native American, hispanic American and Asian American 
students to attend the undergraduate and graduate educational institutions 
of their choice this grant is conditioned on Uncf’s successful annual 
administration of gMsP as determined by the administration agreement and 
the foundation 

during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, the original grant agreement 
was restated to increase the grant amount by $42,000,000 and eliminate the 
previous arrangement of annual installments, replacing it with a lump-sum 
payment and a series of annual payments the cumulative payments through 
March 31, 2005, were $1,042,000,000 

during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, the foundation approved 
enhancements to the original program and awarded gMsP an additional 
amount not to exceed $58,003,043, of which $35 million was received 
during fiscal year 2006 the balance of $23,003,043 was received during 
the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 An additional enhancement grant of 
$10,681,794 to support early outreach, male initiative, alumni development 
and other leadership initiatives was awarded and received as of the fiscal 
year ended March 31, 2007 cumulative enhancement grant payments 
through March 31, 2007, were $68,684,837 

Additionally, during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, the original cost 
estimates for gMsP were evaluated, and it was determined that additional 
funding would be required in order for gMsP to achieve its original objectives 
consequently, the foundation agreed to provide additional funding up to a 
maximum of $472,699,156, of which $31,798,776 was received during the 
fiscal years ended March 31, 2010, and 2009, respectively 

the payment dates and amounts of future installments will be determined 
by the foundation in collaboration with Uncf provided the foundation will 
provide Uncf with no less than 30 days prior written notice of the date and 
amount of each disbursement notwithstanding the foregoing, the final 
disbursement will occur on or before december 31, 2016 

the cumulative payments received through March 31, 2010, which includes 
$31,798,776 received during fiscal year 2010, total $1,259,282,389 with 
additional future funding not to exceed $324,101,604 

gMsP funds are invested and held in separate investment accounts by 
Uncf, and all investment gains and losses and interest and dividends 
earned are restricted for the purpose of the grant (see note 8) 

in accordance with fAsb Asc topic 958-605-25, revenue recognition is 
based on the unconditional/conditional promise to give the restated grant 
agreement requires Uncf to abide by specific performance metrics in any 
case for which performance metrics are not met, the grant agreement may 

 UNCF: A NATIONAL COMMITMENT | 63 

notes to finAnciAl stAteMents (continued) 


be terminated, and any unspent funds, including the accumulated returns 
on invested assets, will be returned to the foundation 
in addition, the agreement also outlines general conditions that stipulate (1) 
in the event of a modification, enlargement, frustration or the impossibility 
of achieving the purposes of the grant agreement and/or (2) Uncf’s 
continued failure to perform any of its duties under the restated grant 
agreement and/or (3) Uncf’s failure to submit an acceptable annual budget 
and/or (4) a significant leadership or other material change that may 
adversely threaten the administration and success of gMsP, the foundation 
has the discretion to cancel the grant agreement, suspend any further 
payments outstanding under the grant agreement, and/or require that any 
portion of the funds, including the accumulated returns on invested assets, 
that were distributed but unexpended to be repaid or transferred to another 
administrator 
due to the conditions placed in the restated grant agreement, the funding 
is treated as a conditional promise to give therefore, the funding received 
will not be recorded as revenue in the year received, but rather as a liability 
(refundable grant advances) with revenue being recognized in the year in 
which the conditions are met returns on gMsP investments are recognized 
as revenue and an increase in temporarily restricted net assets in the period 
such returns are generated by the underlying investments 
for the years ended March 31, 2010, and 2009, the following amounts have 
been received and recognized:

13. Line of Credit and Note Payable 
Line of Credit 
in May 2008, after receiving formal board of directors’ authorization, Uncf 
established a $10 million revolving line of credit (loc) with its master 
custodian bank, JP Morgan chase n A 
the interest rate on this loc is variable and based on a spread of 100

Other 
Uncf is party to various legal actions and claims arising in the ordinary 
course of its business Uncf’s management believes that their ultimate 
disposition will not have a material adverse effect on Uncf’s financial 
position or results of its operations 
21. Related Parties 
UNCF Special Programs Corporation 
on April 1, 2000, Uncf separated its government grant programs and 
all related activities and transferred those activities to the Uncf special 
Programs corporation (the corporation), a separate 501(c)(3) entity 
the President and chief executive officer of Uncf serves as the chairman 
of the board of directors of the corporation and one other member of the 
board of directors of Uncf is also a board member of the corporation 
Uncf does not exercise control nor does it have an economic interest in the 
corporation, as defined by fAsb topic Asc 958-810, not-for-Profit entities 
consolidations (previously known as soP 94-3, reporting of related entities 
by not-for-Profit organizations) therefore, Uncf did not consolidate the 
financial statements of the corporation, and no government grant activities 
are included in Uncf’s accompanying financial statements 
Other 
Uncf receives contributions from donor organizations that have 
representatives on Uncf’s board of directors and from board members

22. Subsequent Events 
Risks and Uncertainties 
due to the level of uncertainty related to changes in interest rates, market 
volatility, and credit risks, it is at least reasonably possible that changes in 
these risks could materially affect the fair value of investments reported in the 
accompanying statements of financial position as of March 31, 2010 however, 
management is of the belief that the diversification of Uncf’s invested assets 
among various asset classes (see notes 5, 7 and 8) should mitigate the impact 
of dramatic change on any one class further, because the values of Uncf’s 
individual investments have and will fluctuate in response to changing market 
conditions, the amount of losses that will be recognized in subsequent periods, 
if any, cannot be determined these trends may also have an effect on the 
ability of donors to fulfill their pledges on a timely basis Management has 
reviewed its contributions and gifts outstanding at March 31, 2010, and does 
not believe that the effects of the market conditions will have a material effect 
on the financial position of Uncf 
Line of Credit Financing 
subsequent to March 31, 2010, Uncf utilized approximately $2,500,000 of 
its available $5,000,000 line of credit to fund various operating activities 
(see note 13) 
Headquarters Relocation 
the executive committee of the Uncf board of directors has authorized 
management to pursue a non-binding agreement to design and build a new

into a purchase and sale agreement for certain commercial condominium 
units with a yet-to-be-constructed building to serve as its new corporate 
headquarters As part of the purchase and sale agreement, Uncf provided 
a $300,000 deposit which is non-refundable except for specific conditions 
the purchase price of the units will be funded by tax-exempt fixed-rate-term 
bonds which Uncf intends to issue by september or october 2010 As of date 
of this report, the financing is expected to approximate $26,000,000 and will be 
considered a general unsecured obligation of Uncf further, negotiations with 
various parties are on-going related to this matter 
Management’s Evaluation
