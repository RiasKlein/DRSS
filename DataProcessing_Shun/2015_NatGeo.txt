LETTER FROM GARY E. KNELL
Dear Friends,
At National Geographic, we believe in the power
of science, exploration, and storytelling to change the
world. For over 127 years, we have funded explorers
who have changed our understanding of our own
human story, opened our eyes to the wonders of our
living planet, taken us to new frontiers, and illuminated
the plight of critical species.
With the support of donors and partners, we're
pushing the boundaries of knowledge and having
an impact on our world. Scientists like Alberto Nava and Lee Berger are uncovering
astonishing clues about human evolution and migration. The Pristine Seas project
has helped governments and communities protect 850,000 square miles of critical
ocean habitat. And we're sparking a global dialogue about the future of food, explor-
ing often polarizing issues and helping people make better choices as individuals
and as a society that must soon feed a global population of nine billion.
National Geographic reaches more than 700 million people worldwide each month
with meaningful and engaging content. Through our magazines, television produc-
tions, books, expeditions, channels, mobile, and social media platforms like Snapchat,
Instagram, and our new Nat Geo View, we're connecting curious individuals every-
where and inspiring them to take action to address the issues we all care about.
We don't do this alone. I am grateful every day to the donors and partners who
believe in our mission and work alongside us to nurture and empower the world's
most innovative minds to help solve the planet's mysteries and challenges. Together,
we are changing the world for the better.
Thank you for your support of the National Geographic Society.

Through exploration and in-depth reporting, we help
others understand the amazing, intricate, and interconnected
systems of our changing planet.
WE LIVE ON A BLUE PLANET. The ocean sustains life on Earth and supplies half the
oxygen we breathe. Overfishing, pollution, climate change, and other immediate
threats prompted National Geographic to take action to protect ocean wildlife and
restore the health and productivity of the ocean.
National Geographic's Pristine Seas is helping create large, "no take" marine
reserves to protect the last wild places in the ocean. Led by Explorer-in-Residence
Enric Sala, Pristine Seas works with organizations, communities, and governments
to encourage the protection of the last reservoirs of marine wilderness: remote areas
that provide a blueprint for conserving other ocean ecosystems. Pristine Seas has
already inspired the protection of 850,000 square miles (2.2 million square kilo-
meters) of ocean across the globe and is contributing to the international goal of
protecting 10 percent of the ocean by 2020.
In March 2015, the United Kingdom established the world's largest contiguous
ocean reserve around the Pitcairn Islands in the South Pacific, thanks in part to the
work of Pristine Seas and key partners. A 2012 National Geographic expedition
to the region, led by Sala, revealed several new species of fish and a vibrant ecosys-
tem in need of protection. The new reserve is just over 322,000 square miles
In its first expedition of
2015, the Pristine Seas team
journeyed to the island
groups of Aldabra and
Cosmoledo in the Seychelles
to document untouched
habitats teeming with
wildlife (preceding pages).

(834,000 square kilometers) and is home to more than 1,200 species of marine
mammals, seabirds, and fish.
In September 2014, President Barack Obama expanded the Pacific Remote
Islands Marine National Monument to nearly 490,000 square miles (1.27 million square
kilometers), six times its previous size. Years of work by the Pristine Seas team, includ-
ing expeditions to Kingman Reef and other ecosystems in the northern Line Islands,
helped make possible the original designation of this monument in 2009 and its
expansion in 2015.
In November 2014, at the World Parks Congress in Sydney, Australia, Gabon
President Ali Bongo Ondimba announced a network of marine parks protecting 23
percent of his country's territorial waters. This announcement built on the October
2012 Pristine Seas expedition led by National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence Mike
Fay and Sala to the coast of Gabon, where the team surveyed and documented the
country's underwater world.
The Line Islands were so named because they straddle the Equator, known to sailors as
"the line." Malden Island (left) is largely barren above water but is rich in underwater
biodiversity, which attracted scientists from the Pristine Seas project.
CARING FOR OUR LIVING PLANET
Other Pristine Seas expeditions in 2014, to the southern coast of Mozambique,
Palau, and Rapa Iti/Marotiri, have yielded assessments of marine health and
biodiversity that will help the team inspire the creation of new marine sanctuaries.
Over the next four years, Pristine Seas will target 16 additional pristine places--
areas ranging from Antarctica to the Arctic--to help bring about their protection
and ultimately restore the health and resilience of the ocean.
The work of Pristine Seas is made possible through the generous contributions
of the following principal donors: Blancpain, Keith Campbell Foundation for the
Environment, The Case Foundation, Davidoff Cool Water, Leonardo DiCaprio
Foundation, Rosemary and Roger Enrico, The Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley
Charitable Trust, Jynwel Foundation, Sven Lindblad/Lindblad Expeditions, Vicki and
Roger Sant, The Philip Stephenson Foundation, and The Waitt Foundation.

I admire big ideas, bold thinkers, and nonprofits with an entrepreneurial
focus--all of which are evident in National Geographic's mission and
the work of the explorers and scientists it supports. I choose to give
to National Geographic because it is supporting technological
innovation, researching the unknown, and bringing remarkable stories
of science and discovery to the world.

than 100,000 educators into a community
that promotes geographic literacy. Every day
these teachers rely on National Geographic
classroom materials and teacher trainings to
inspire their students. And beginning in 2015,
these educators will have the chance to join
our new Educator Community and become
Nat Geo Certified Educators, enabling them
to share best practices with their peers and
take their own teaching to a new level. National
Geographic Trustee and Education Foundation
board member Brendan Bechtel and his family
have provided early support for this work.
EMPOWERING THE NEXT
GENERATION OF SCIENTISTS
AND EXPLORERS
At National Geographic, we believe in the
power of science, exploration, and storytelling
to inspire young people to care for our chang-
ing world and make it a better place. Our goal
is to spark curiosity about the planet and the
life it sustains, and bring students, families,
and educators together to work out solutions
to the problems of today and tomorrow.
Underpinning all of National Geographic's
efforts to inspire and teach children about the
world is our Learning Framework. This new
framework outlines the attitudes, skills, and
knowledge we believe students need in order
to be effective global citizens and explorers.
It is consistent with the latest educational re-
search and standards, and is informed by our
own rich history of work with leading scien-
tists and explorers.
The Learning Framework also lays out what
people of all ages should learn from their
experiences with National Geographic. These
include programs like the annual BioBlitz--
a celebration of science in partnership with
the National Park Service which enlists young
Other educational experiences include
the National Geographic Bee, sponsored by
Google, which takes place each spring in Wash-
ington, D.C., and spurs more than four million
students from 11,000 schools across the U.S. to
find out more about the world. The 2015 cham-
pionship brought in 54 contestants from state
and territory bees. The winner, Karan Menon, 14,
answered every final-round question correctly,
edging out the runner-up, Shriya Yarlagadda, 11,
who missed only one question.
National Geographic also works directly
with teachers. Our Alliance Network links more
people in the task of caring for our intercon-
nected world. BioBlitz takes participants on
a 24-hour species inventory of a different
national park each year, gathering students,
families, and scientists to ask questions,
observe the natural world, and learn how to
care for the animals, plants, and habitats
around us. The 2014 event, at the Golden Gate
National Recreation Area in California, was
made possible by the Golden Gate National
Parks Conservancy, the Gordon and Betty
Moore Foundation, the Harold M. and Adeline
S. Morrison Family Foundation, NatureBridge,
the Pisces Foundation, Point Reyes National
Seashore Association, the Presidio Trusts, the
San Francisco Foundation, Southwest Airlines,
the Verizon Foundation, and Verizon Wireless.

THE DIVERS WHO FOUND THE BONES chose the name Naia, after the water nymphs
of Greek mythology. The remains were discovered in 2007, when Mexican divers
exploring a vast underwater cave system in the Yucatán Peninsula came upon
an immense cavern they dubbed Hoyo Negro--the "black hole." Naia's bones lay
at the bottom of the abyss, where she had fallen more than a hundred feet to
her death during the last ice age, before the cave was submerged.
With grants from National Geographic, Alberto Nava and the National Institute of
Anthropology and History led further expeditions to Hoyo Negro to investigate the
cave and its contents and recover Naia's skeleton. The journey to the chamber where
her bones were located was perilous: Divers had to climb into a sinkhole and swim
through a 200-foot tunnel to the rim of Hoyo Negro before dropping the hundred
feet to the bottom. Working with National Geographic's engineering department, the
team documented the inside of the chamber, making 360-degree composite photos,
powerful high-resolution images, and 3-D scans.

The bones of at least 26 Ice Age animals--including those of an elephant-like gomphothere
(above)--litter the floor of Hoyo Negro, the flooded cave where divers found Naia's remains.
The cavern was mostly dry during Naia's short life. She may have fallen to her death while
exploring the cave's dark passages (right).

REVEALING OUR HUMAN STORY
More than 12,000 years old, Naia--the oldest, most complete human skeleton
ever discovered in the New World--is helping solve an enduring mystery. If Native
Americans are descendants of people who migrated from Asia to the Americas,
why don't they look like their ancient ancestors? A reconstruction of Naia's face
reveals features typical of the earliest Americans, but DNA analysis of her skeleton
shows genetic signatures common to modern Native Americans, establishing
a definitive link between the earliest Americans and modern Native Americans.
The Hoyo Negro project was the cover story in the January 2015 issue of National
Geographic and will be featured in a National Geographic/NOVA special on PBS.

REVEALING OUR HUMAN STORY
REWRITING THE STORY OF
OUR EVOLUTION
"There it was, right there," said Lee Berger,
paleoanthropologist and National Geographic
explorer-in-residence, of a once-in-a-lifetime
discovery--one of the most spectacular sets of
early hominin fossils ever found, lying on a cave
floor a hundred feet underground. "History
would never forgive me if I didn't act then."
Berger has devoted his career to searching
for a prehistoric link between the Australo-
pithecus and Homo genera in South Africa. He
hired some cavers to search for fossils, and in
2013 two daredevils stumbled upon a find in
the far reaches of the Rising Star cave system.
Berger couldn't enter the cave himself;
the tight squeeze was less than eight inches
wide in places. To assemble a team, he put out
a call on Facebook for caver anthropologists
who could fit through the passage. Six young
women qualified for the expedition.
More than 1,700 bones were recovered,
representing one of the biggest caches of
hominin fossils ever found. Berger wanted to
have the fossils analyzed quickly, so he broke
from the traditional model of holding informa-
tion close until it can be published. Fifty scien-
tists from 15 countries took part in the work.
A DIGITAL CAMPFIRE BURNS
BRIGHTER
National Geographic Fellow and Pulitzer
Prize-winning writer Paul Salopek is now in the
third year of his unprecedented seven-year
adventure--an epic, 21,000-mile journey that
retraces the path of early human migration,
beginning at the birthplace of humanity in
Ethiopia and ending at Tierra del Fuego, at the
tip of South America. The Out of Eden Walk
links the age-old tradition of the walking
storyteller with digital tools and emerging
multimedia technologies to share the stories
of ordinary people, who are usually unseen
behind the headlines.
A generous grant from Knight Foundation
will help National Geographic develop innova-
tive tools for deeper digital engagement with
Salopek's avid online followers. This support
is expanding this "digital campfire" to create
a dynamic, integrated online experience that
brings Salopek and the people he encounters
on his walk together with curious online audi-
ences around the globe.
While walking in Turkey, Paul Salopek (above left) leads his mule past the first-century B.C. Karaku
royal tomb. Salopek reported on ethnic Kurds fleeing conflict in Syria (top left). Marina Elliott
(above), one of six "underground astronauts," sits at the entrance to the Rising Star cave system.
As the scientific revelations come to light,
the story of the journey to answer the many
questions raised by the Rising Star find will
be shared with the world in the pages of our
magazine, online, and through TV and video.
A generous investment from entrepreneur
and International Council of Advisors member
Lyda Hill is helping fund the next five years of
Berger's work. So far, his team has excavated
just one square yard of a vast cave system.
This engrossing tale is a vivid reminder of how
much is still to be revealed about our past.

FEEDING NINE BILLION
HOW TO BALANCE APPETITE AND AGRICULTURE
· 
By 2050 we'll have two billion more mouths to feed--more
than nine billion people.
· 
Increasing prosperity around the globe is driving up demand
for meat, eggs, and dairy and creating pressure to grow
more corn and soybeans to feed cattle, pigs, and chickens.
· 
The confluence of population growth and richer diets
will require us to double the amount of crops we grow by
mid-century.

BY 2050 THERE WILL BE NINE BILLION PEOPLE on Earth. As our need for food has
grown, so has the damage caused by agriculture. When we think about threats to
the environment, images of congested highways or clear-cut forests probably come
to mind. The fact is, agriculture is a greater contributor to global warming than
transportation and has significant effects on water supply, pollution, and biodiversity.
Finding a fair and secure way to feed ourselves is a huge challenge of the 21st century.
In 2014, National Geographic launched a multiyear, multiplatform initiative to
explore how we can feed nine billion people--without overwhelming the planet.
World-class journalism and photography, compelling videos and TV specials, live
presentations and demonstrations, interactive mapping, and infographics have
made National Geographic's Future of Food initiative part of a global conversation.
In-depth features in National Geographic magazine and online have covered
complex and controversial topics such as genetically modified crops; hunger,
malnutrition, and obesity in America, the richest country on Earth; and the conflict
between large-scale agriculture and subsistence farmers in Africa. The six-part
miniseries Eat: The Story of Food aired on the National Geographic Channel in
November 2014; it examined how humanity's appetite has altered--and continues
to alter--the Earth. Dynamic live presentations and interactions, including an evening
with Washington's top chefs and a farm-to-table sustainable meal, were part of
National Geographic Live in fall 2014. Through nationalgeographic.com and other online
media sites, Future of Food content has already reached more than a billion people.
The Future of Food initiative would not be possible without the generous support
of The Rockefeller Foundation, The 1772 Foundation, The Christensen Fund, and
GRACE Communications Foundation.

WRAPPING OUR HEADS
AROUND THE HUMAN BRAIN
Brain science represents one of the greatest
scientific revolutions of our time, and National
Geographic is sharing new discoveries with
people around the world. A cover story from
the February 2014 issue of National Geographic
revealed how scientists at Harvard have been
able to re-create a portion of a mouse brain
the size of a grain of salt. That tiny speck
contains a hundred terabytes of data, the
amount you'd find in 25,000 high-definition
movies. The February 2015 cover story delved
into another aspect of brain science: the
devastating effects of blast-force trauma on
a soldier's brain, a condition affecting hun-
dreds of thousands of U.S. combat personnel
who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. These
unique stories--blending hard science with
deeply human narratives, sensitively told--
connect and move people to reflect on issues
that concern us all.
A COSMIC JOURNEY FOR
A NEW GENERATION
In 2014, the National Geographic Channel
aired the critically acclaimed 13-part television
series Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey. This
Peabody and Emmy Award-winning series
is a modern update of the classic 1980 mini-
series Cosmos: A Personal Voyage, with Carl
Sagan. In the new show, astrophysicist Neil
deGrasse Tyson took an audience of 135 mil-
lion viewers in 180 countries on a breathtak-
ing adventure through the universe. Viewers
young and old learned profound scientific
concepts, witnessed a stunning vision of the
cosmos on a grand scale, and contemplated
our place in the universe. Tyson is continu-

ing to inspire and excite audiences with Star
Talk, a new show on the National Geographic
Channel. "Cosmos allowed us to share the
awesome power of the universe with a global
audience in ways that we never thought pos-
sible," says Tyson. "To be able to continue to
spread wonder and excitement through Star
Talk, which is a true passion project for me, is
beyond exciting."
While viewers were tuning in, visitors
to the National Geographic Museum in Wash-
ington, D.C., were treated to a free exhibition

WITH GENEROUS SUPPORT FROM DONORS, National Geographic's Big Cats Initiative
invests in on-the-ground conservation programs that will have the greatest impact on
the dire situation facing big cats. Since 2010, BCI has supported 73 conservation projects
in 25 countries, and, in 2014, we made our first grants to support jaguar conservation.
BCI's Build a Boma program allows donors to directly support the communities
that live with big cats by helping them build and improve bomas, traditional livestock
corrals that serve as a barrier between herds and big cats. Sturdy bomas keep
livestock safe from attack by big cats, just as they keep big cats safe from retaliatory
killings by the herders who depend on livestock for income. Build a Boma helped
construct 262 new bomas in Kenya and Tanzania in 2014. The enclosures protect more
than 50 lions a year in a region that is critical for their long-term survival. To learn

A MESSAGE FROM MICHAEL ULICA,
CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER
Members and donors of the National Geographic Society make an investment in science,
exploration, and storytelling. One way we show our commitment to our mission--and
the trust our supporters place in us to achieve it--is through careful management
of our financial resources. Because our financial position is strong, in 2014 the National
Geographic Society was able to increase programmatic spending.
National Geographic's 2014 financial performance remained steady, with revenues and
philanthropic support at $498.3 million. Programmatic costs represented 89 percent
of expenses, with management and fundraising accounting for 11 percent of expenses.
Net assets of $800.9 million represented an 11 percent decrease from 2013.

SUSTAINABILITY
At National Geographic, sustainability isn't just a catchword; it's a way of life.
The National Geographic Society aims to be an international leader for conservation
and environmental sustainability. In 2003, our headquarters became the first existing
buildings in the U.S. to receive LEED-EB certification. We recertified at Gold in 2009
and have recertified at Gold three times since. Leading by example, the Society has
put innovative green initiatives into effect across our enterprise.
· 
Since 2014, National Geographic has awarded small grants to employees for original
ideas that will advance sustainability in the workplace and in our community.
· 
The Society's rooftop garden is providing herbs and vegetables for our cafeteria.
· 
In 2014, the Society added a bicycle-commuter benefit to its slate of benefits for em-
ployees who commute to work by bike, public transit, carpool, or low-emission vehicle.
· 
In 2014, National Geographic began offering deep discounts to employees for
purchasing, financing, and installing solar panels at their homes at a flat rate that
averages close to 34 percent lower than the national average.
· 
By deploying compost and recycling stations throughout our office space,
we're diverting around 75 percent of our waste away from landfills.
