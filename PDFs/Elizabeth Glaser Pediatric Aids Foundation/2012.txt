ELIMINATING NEW HIV INFECTIONS AMONG CHILDREN IS NO LONGER
JUST A DREAM. WE ARE CLOSER THAN EVER TO ACHIEVING OUR MISSION
TO END PEDIATRIC AIDS.
In 2012, approximately 1 in 6 expectant mothers in low-
and middle-income countries who received lifesaving
antiretroviral medicine did so through a clinic supported by
the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation (EGPAF) or
its affiliates. Our staff of nearly 1,000 employees channels
its energy, expertise, and innovation into programs that
effectively prevent HIV and provide care and treatment
for those living with HIV and AIDS—collaborating with
key partners, including the U.S. government, ministries of
health in host countries, the United Nations Children’s Fund
(UNICEF), the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS
(UNAIDS), and the World Health Organization (WHO).
A high point of the year was the International AIDS Society
Conference (AIDS 2012), which took place in Washington,
D.C., in July. The conference brought together nearly
24,000 experts from around the world—researchers, policy
makers, journalists, and people living with HIV—to share
knowledge about the AIDS pandemic and prognoses for
ending it.
EGPAF played a prominent role at AIDS 2012, with field
and U.S.-based staff participating in panel discussions,
press conferences, satellite sessions, poster exhibits, and
the EGPAF exhibit booth. Elizabeth Glaser’s legacy was
frequently evoked throughout the week, as Michel Sidibé,
executive director of UNAIDS, and other leaders stressed
her crucial role in sparking a unified effort to eliminate AIDS
in children.
On Dec. 1, 2012, World AIDS Day, the U.S. State Department
released its PEPFAR Blueprint: Creating an AIDS-free
Generation. At the report’s launch event, EGPAF Global
Ambassador Florence Ngobeni-Allen introduced Secretary
of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, who outlined a bold
strategy to eliminate AIDS by boosting policy, investment,
and advocacy through the U.S. Presidents Emergency Plan
for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR).
The Blueprint focuses on specific strategies, with the
prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV
at the top of that list.
With this renewed vision of a generation free of AIDS,
the work of EGPAF takes on even more importance.
Fortunately, EGPAF’s financial commitment remains strong,
with 88 cents of every dollar raised going directly to our
programs. We also continue to receive top ratings from
leading philanthropic watchdog organizations for our
adherence to the most stringent standards of financial
performance and accountability.
In March, our board of directors elected new co-chairs:
Willow Bay, senior editor at the Huffington Post, and
Russ Hagey, worldwide chief talent officer at Bain &
Company. Their combined communications and managerial
expertise, as well as their deep commitment to children,
help propel our organization forward and set a standard
of excellence in leadership. We were also pleased to
welcome Paula Kerger, president and chief executive
officer of PBS, to our board of directors and look forward
to her counsel on strategic communication matters.
I continue to be energized by and deeply proud to be
leading an organization that balances operational acumen,
scientific innovation, programmatic excellence, and
effective advocacy. More importantly, I am hugely gratified
that you have chosen to support EGPAF. Because of your
generosity, millions of women, children, and families around
the world are able to live and thrive.
Best regards,

THE ELIZABETH GLASER PEDIATRIC AIDS FOUNDATION SEEKS TO PREVENT
HIV INFECTION AND TO ERADICATE PEDIATRIC AIDS THROUGH RESEARCH,
ADVOCACY, AND PREVENTION AND TREATMENT PROGRAMS.
Twenty years ago, Elizabeth Glaser addressed
the Democratic National Convention, bringing the
heartbreaking reality of HIV into living rooms across the
United States, awakening her nation and the world. In
1992, with few treatment options and limited political will,
Elizabeth knew well the tragic prognosis of those living with
HIV—especially children, having lost her daughter, Ariel, to
AIDS-related illness four years earlier.
Elizabeth reminded us of our moral responsibility to end
HIV and AIDS. “We are all in a struggle between life and
death,” Elizabeth declared. “We all need to hope that our
dreams can come true. I challenge you to make it happen,
because all our lives, not just mine, depend on it.”
Elizabeth sparked a movement that has led to the
development of effective medicines and programs for
preventing transmission of HIV from mothers to children
and providing treatment for those children who do contract
the virus. Today, fewer than 200 babies are born with HIV
in the United States each year, and other high-income
countries have similar low numbers.
Extending that success around the globe, EGPAF—working
with other global organizations and governments—has
dramatically reduced the spread of HIV and provided
millions of children and families with access to the services
they need to remain healthy. In 2012, 1.1 million fewer
people around the world became infected with HIV than in
2001. New HIV infections among children have fallen by 24
percent over the past two years.
.
But the fight is not yet won. Each day, 700 children are
born with HIV because their mothers lack access to the
medicine, health care, and information necessary to keep
their babies HIV-free and themselves healthy.
Our staff works diligently to fulfill Elizabeth’s mission of
reaching the day when each mother or mother-to-be living
with HIV receives the care and support she needs; when
no child is burdened with a virus for which there is still no
cure; when all countries have the ability to adequately care
for families and children living with HIV. In 2012, EGPAF’s
programmatic support, scientific and research innovations,
and advocacy campaigns made a real difference in the
lives of millions of children, mothers, and families.

FEBRUARY
Project HEART1
(Help Expand Antiretroviral Therapy to
children and families) officially ends. Over 10 years, more
than 1 million people worldwide received HIV care and
support services through Project HEART, and more than
2.5 million pregnant women received services to prevent
mother-to-child transmission of HIV. EGPAF affiliates in
Tanzania, Côte d’Ivoire, and Mozambique—established in
2011 in anticipation of the conclusion of Project HEART—
became increasingly independent and productive in 2012.
EGPAF introduces new websites and a resources toolkit to
support its new affiliates in Côte d’Ivoire, Mozambique,
and Tanzania.
1 Project Heart was funded through PEPFAR in coordination with the CDC.
MAY
In coordination with the U.S. Agency for International
Development (USAID), EGPAF publishes Eliminating
Pediatric AIDS in Tanzania, a photo book highlighting
its work through hope-filled profiles of people who have
benefited from EGPAF-supported programs.
JULY
The International AIDS Society Conference (AIDS 2012) in Washington, D.C., draws nearly 24,000 experts from 183 countries
and includes 194 sessions. EGPAF provides two oral presentations, 26 poster presentations, and six workshops—with updates
during the conference through a dedicated blog. EGPAF also releases a revamped media toolkit, “A Journalist’s Guide to
Reporting on Pediatric HIV and AIDS.”
EGPAF commemorates the 20th anniversary of Elizabeth Glaser’s iconic speech at the 1992 Democratic National Convention.
President and CEO Charles Lyons publishes an article through the Huffington Post about the legacy of her call to action and
the charge to eliminate pediatric AIDS worldwide.
SEPTEMBER
EGPAF President and CEO Charles Lyons participates in
an online discussion “Eradicating AIDS,” hosted by the
Huffington Post. Lyons is joined by a diverse panel of
experts who discuss antiretroviral treatment and the state
of research toward a vaccine and a cure.
NOVEMBER
EGPAF receives funding from the CDC through PEPFAR
for the Malamu Project, a new five-year program that
will increase services in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo to prevent the transmission of HIV from mothers to
children. The program also integrates screening for sexual
and gender-based violence into routine mother-to-child
prevention services.
OCTOBER
EGPAF partners with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) and Malawi’s Ministry of Health to
administer a five-year program to strengthen HIV services.
Funded by the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS
Relief (PEPFAR), the program will strengthen district-level
health capacity and systems.
DECEMBER
On World AIDS Day, Dec. 1, 2012, EGPAF Global
Ambassador Florence Ngobeni-Allen introduces U.S.
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton at the launch
event for the PEPFAR Blueprint: Creating an AIDS-free
Generation. The Blueprint states that “[s]cientific advances
and their successful implementation have brought the
world to a tipping point in the fight against AIDS.”
MARCH
EGPAF-supported scientists and clinicians, including
EGPAF International Leadership Awardee Landon Myer
from South Africa and Benjamin Chi from Zambia, present

OUR GLOBAL
In 2012, EGPAF’s dedicated staff of nearly 1,000 helped save millions of lives in collaboration with key partners, including
the United States government, ministries of health in host countries, multilateral organizations such as the United Nations
Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the World Health Organization (WHO), and private donors. Nearly 800 of EGPAF employees are
nationals in the countries most affected by HIV and AIDS, fostering greater efficiency and national ownership.

and children
EGPAF AFFILIATES EGPAF is
committed to supporting country
ownership of efforts to end HIV.
With the end of Project HEARTin
February 2012, EGPAF transitioned
many of its program activities to new
affiliates in Côte d’Ivoire (Fondation
Ariel Glaser pour la Lutte contre le SIDA
Pédiatrique), Mozambique (Fundação
Ariel Glaser Contra o SIDA Pediátrico),
and Tanzania (Ariel Glaser Pediatric
AIDS Healthcare Initiative), with each
affiliate implementing directly funded
awards from the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
OPTION B+ In 2012, EGPAF
responded to a groundswell
of support from WHO and global
health groups to adopt Option B+
within existing programs. In contrast to
Option A and Option B—both of which
limit the use of antiretroviral medicines
to expectant mothers deemed most
vulnerable—Option B+ will provide
those medicines for all pregnant
women living with HIV, regardless of
the severity of infection. Under Option
B+, treatment will extend through the
lifetimes of those mothers.
MOBILE TECHNOLOGIES
FOR HEALTH (MHEALTH)
EGPAF partnered with Johnson &
Johnson and the mHealth Alliance to
explore communications tools that can
more effectively link women, health
workers, facilities, and laboratories in
the countries where EGPAF works—
using wireless networks, mobile
telephones, and mobile applications.
6
SCIENTIFIC
EGPAF has earned global respect for leadership in pediatric AIDS research. We support innovative projects,
collaborate with the brightest scientific minds, and bridge gaps within the medical and research communities—to ensure
that children, mothers, and families in the areas of the world hardest hit by HIV and AIDS are served by the best medical
information and practices.
At the end of 2012, EGPAF led 25 active research projects.
HIGHLIGHTS
THE KABEHO STUDY
The U.S. Agency for International
Development (USAID) granted EGPAF
funding for the Kigali Antiretroviral
and Breastfeeding Assessment for
the Elimination of HIV (the Kabeho
Study). This three-year, $2.8 million
project, funded through the U.S.
President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS
Relief (PEPFAR), will evaluate the
survival in infants born to expectant
Rwandan mothers living with HIV
who participate in Option B+, an
innovative new initiative to prevent
the transmission of HIV from mother
to child.
PROJECT ACCLAIM
(Advancing Community-Level Action for
Improving Maternal and Child Health
and Prevention of Mother-to-Child
Transmission of HIV)
Project ACCLAIM2
tests the effect,
individually and jointly, of three
community-based interventions
to increase demand, uptake, and
retention of services for maternal and
child health (MCH) and prevention of
mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT)
of HIV. These interventions include
•	engaging community leaders to
increase demand for MCH and
PMTCT services;
•	hosting forums to promote
community awareness, education,
and dialogue on MCH, PMTCT, and
general health issues; and
•	establishing peer support groups
to promote greater involvement by
men and improve knowledge and
attitudes toward MCH and PMTCT
services by pregnant women.
2 Project ACCLAIM is supported by the Canadian International
Development Agency (CIDA).
HIVCORE
EGPAF is a leading member
of HIVCORE, a new partnership
focused on improving the scale
and speed of HIV care and treatment
and PMTCT efforts. Under the
leadership of the Population Council,
EGPAF is conducting a multicountry
retrospective study of retention
in PMTCT services for countries
implementing different PMTCT
options (Kenya and Swaziland with
Option A, Rwanda with Option B,
and Malawi with Option B+). An
additional protocol for Tanzania has
also been developed.

PUBLICATIONS AND CONFERENCES
Several EGPAF-led studies were published in 2012.
Two are highlighted below.
In addition, Dr. Peter Mudiope received the Women, Girls, and HIV Investigators Prize at the AIDS 2012 conference, held in
Washington, D.C., in July for his abstract of an EGPAF-supported study in Uganda.5
At the 19th annual Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI) in March, Dr. Landon Myer, EGPAF
international leadership awardee, presented data from South Africa about the often fatal outcome of pregnant women with
HIV who do not continue clinic visits and drug regimens. This supports EGPAF’s work on adherence to treatment. In the
same session, Dr. Benjamin Chi, EGPAF’s operations research grantee, presented findings that confirm the effectiveness of
providing universal antiretroviral therapy to all pregnant women living with HIV.

When Elizabeth Glaser discovered that the medicines prolonging her own life were unavailable to her young daughter, Ariel,
because they had not yet been tested on children, she became one of the first people to champion the needs of children
living with HIV. Building on Elizabeth’s legacy, EGPAF works with policymakers around the world to continue the work she
started, advocating for the best public policies for children, women, and families affected by HIV and AIDS.
During an International AIDS Society Conference (AIDS 2012) bipartisan congressional breakfast, EGPAF Global Ambassador
Florence Ngobeni-Allen addressed U.S. lawmakers, bringing a mother’s voice to Capitol Hill. Ngobeni-Allen is living with HIV
and lost a husband and a daughter to the virus. She told the audience about the pain that a parent feels when a child dies.
Then Ngobeni-Allen related the joy she now feels to have two young sons who were born without HIV, thanks to the U.S.
President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and EGPAF.
EGPAF remains true to Elizabeth Glaser’s fighting spirit by working to ensure that the needs of families affected by HIV and
AIDS are at the top of the political agenda.
PUBLIC POLICY &
HIGHLIGHTS
PEDIATRIC DRUG
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
EGPAF worked with the
American Academy of Pediatrics
on reauthorizing the Best
Pharmaceuticals for Children Act and
the Pediatric Research Equity Act. In
early July, President Barack Obama
signed into law the Food and Drug
Administration Safety and Innovation
Act, which included both of those
measures, ensuring that safe and
effective medicines will continue to
reach children.
AFRICA-BASED ADVOCACY EGPAF’s public policy and advocacy team participated in the African Union’s Fourth
Interagency Meeting on Coordination and Harmonization of HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Strategies. Throughout the
year, EGPAF consulted regularly on the African version of the United Nations’ Global Plan. EGPAF President and CEO Charles
Lyons serves on the Global Steering Group (GSG), which guides the implementation of the Global Plan at the country level.
EGPAF hosts the Global Steering Group Secretariat in its Nairobi, Kenya, office.
CONSULTATION WITH
PEDIATRIC AIDS STAKEHOLDERS
IN THE UNITED STATES
In November 2012, EGPAF hosted a
stakeholder consultation on pediatric
HIV and AIDS in the United States.
Policy experts, patients, and caregivers
convened to discuss continuing issues for
children and adolescents living with HIV—
and the best role for EGPAF in addressing
those issues. Participants included EGPAF
ambassadors, U.S. government officials,
advocacy groups, scientific leaders,
clinicians, and EGPAF staff.
SAVING LIVES
ON THE FRONTLINES
On Dec. 5, 2012, EGPAF joined Save
the Children and the Frontline Health
Workers Coalition to release an issue
brief, “Saving Lives on the Frontlines:
Eliminating Pediatric HIV and AIDS.”
The brief enhances the PEPFAR
Blueprint that was launched on World
AIDS Day, Dec. 1, 2012. It lays out the
needs of health care providers as they
work to eliminate pediatric AIDS—
with an emphasis on the demand
for additional health workers and for
more training and support.

THE 2012 INTERNATIONAL
AIDS SOCIETY CONFERENCE
TOOK PLACE IN WASHINGTON
IN JULY.
The conference marked the 2010 lifting of
the HIV Travel and Immigration Ban, which
had barred people living with HIV from
entering the United States since 1987.
On the eve of the conference, Elizabeth’s son, Jake
Glaser, gave a stirring speech at a Kennedy Center tribute
concert. Standing beside Barbara Bush, daughter of former
President George W. Bush, and Kweku Mandela, grandson
of former South Africa President Nelson Mandela, Glaser
voiced the commitment of young advocates everywhere:
“We are the next generation. This is our fight now.”
Glaser’s speech came almost exactly 20 years after his
mother’s landmark call to arms at the 1992 Democratic
National Convention.
THE INTERNATIONAL AIDS
SOCIETY CONFERENCE (AIDS 2012)
AIDS 2012 will be most remembered for its push for a generation free of HIV and AIDS, an
idea that was first promoted by Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton in a 2011 policy speech
at the National Institutes of Health. That goal resonated throughout the conference as a
reference point, a call to action, and a challenge.
This was the first International AIDS Society conference in the United States since it was held in
San Francisco in 1990. The conference brought together nearly 24,000 experts from 183 countries to
share knowledge about HIV treatment through 200 sessions and nearly 4,000 abstracts.
EGPAF played a prominent role at AIDS 2012, with field and
U.S.-based staff engaging fully in the conference. Along
with participating in panel discussions, press conferences,
and poster exhibits, EGPAF joined the International
Parliamentary Union to host a roundtable discussion to
introduce policy makers from around the world to EGPAF’s
work and to explore contributions they can make to
eliminate transmission of HIV from mothers to children in
their countries. The discussion has resulted in new areas
of cooperation in Zimbabwe, Kenya, and other EGPAF-
supported countries.
11
The Blueprint is specific, action-
oriented, and time bound—and it
sets priorities for achieving the
elimination of pediatric HIV and AIDS.
While the Blueprint highlights U.S. contributions through the
U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR),
it also sharpens the focus on shared global responsibilities
and country ownership—as well as the vital contributions
needed from the private sector, civil society, and people
living with HIV.
As one of PEPFAR’s first implementing partners and one
of the largest global providers of prevention of mother-to-
child transmission of HIV and care and treatment services,
EGPAF is committed to achieving an AIDS-free generation,
and we’re pleased to see women and children at the core
of this strategy.
A crucial first step to an AIDS-free generation is ensuring
that no child is born with HIV, and EGPAF welcomes the
Blueprint’s strong focus on eliminating new HIV infections
in children. Progress in the world’s hardest-hit regions has
been astounding—with the number of new HIV infections in
children cut nearly in half since PEPFAR’s launch in 2003.
PEPFAR BLUEPRINT PROVIDES A ROAD MAP
FOR ACHIEVING AN AIDS-FREE GENERATION
Ultimately, the Blueprint makes a strong promise to the next generation: that they will be born
HIV-free, that they will have access to HIV treatment with drugs that are safe and effective
if they contract HIV, and that they will receive services designed to keep them healthy into
adulthood and beyond—until a cure is found.
The PEPFAR Blueprint also provides a road map for the U.S. government to build on previous
investments that have transformed the global AIDS landscape, and make strategic investments to hasten
the end of the epidemic.

COUNTRY PROFILE
“LESSONS LEARNED FROM OUR WORK WILL PROVIDE PROMISING MODELS ON
HOW TO ELIMINATE AIDS IN KENYA AND IN OTHER COUNTRIES AFFECTED BY
THE PANDEMIC.”—Titus Syengo, EGPAF-Kenya director
The Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation began
working in Kenya in 2000 as a small, privately funded
initiative to prevent the transmission of HIV from mothers
to their children. It has since grown into one of the largest
HIV prevention, care, and treatment programs in that
country. Through partnerships with the government of
Kenya, the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief
(PEPFAR), the U.S. Agency for International Development
(USAID), the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC), and other implementing organizations
and private donors, EGPAF-Kenya has supported lifesaving
HIV prevention and care and treatment services for millions
of women and children.
In 2012, nearly 13,000 children were infected with HIV
in Kenya, 90 percent as a result of mother-to-child
transmission of HIV. Five out of 10 pregnant women
living with HIV did not receive antiretroviral medication
to prevent transmission of HIV to their babies, and 8 out
of 10 mothers did not receive antiretroviral medication
during breastfeeding.
As one of the 22 priority countries under the United
Nations Global Plan, Kenya’s fight to eliminate pediatric
AIDS continues. Although the numbers of new HIV
infections among children have recently fallen, much still
needs to be done to improve HIV and health services.
The Kenyan government’s commitment to providing free
maternity services within all public health services and the
waiving of user fees in all public dispensaries are some of
the country’s promising initiatives.
Taking strides to achieve the United Nations’ Millennium
Development Goals by 2015, Kenya is scaling up its
Mentor Mother program to the national level, providing
improved support to women living with HIV. The country
is also strengthening exclusive breastfeeding support.
In 2012, EGPAF-Kenya published the results of operations
research comparing services and care for HIV-exposed
infants. The results showed that the percentage of infant
visits to integrated maternal and child health clinics were
far higher than those to comprehensive care clinics that
focus solely on treating HIV.
This study shows promise for reaching more women
and children with HIV services so that they live long,
healthy lives.
14
OUR GENEROUS
THE CONRAD N. HILTON FOUNDATION
The Conrad N. Hilton Foundation has been an enthusiastic
supporter of EGPAF’s work to treat pediatric HIV and AIDS.
In 2012, the two organizations joined forces to improve the
prospects of thousands of children through Survive and
Thrive, a program for expanding access to comprehensive
early child development services in Zambia. Funding for
HIV and AIDS interventions generally concentrates on
health and nutrition, with few resources for early childhood
development. Survive and Thrive meets that often-ignored
need by improving the ability and capacity of families
and communities to promote the healthy development
of children living with HIV. The program assists parents
and caregivers, enhances the ability of community-based
organizations to deliver quality programs and services,
and encourages country-level stakeholders to leverage
investments and resources.
THE JOHN W. CARSON FOUNDATION
The legacy of much-loved Tonight Show host Johnny
Carson lives on through the charitable work of the John
W. Carson Foundation, established by the late entertainer
in 1981 to support children, education, health services,
protection of wildlife, the homeless, and the entertainment
and media industry. Since 2007, EGPAF has been a grateful
recipient of the John W. Carson Foundation’s philanthropy,
first in support of the annual Los Angeles Golf Tournament
and in recent years through the A Time for Heroes family
picnic. Thanks to the generosity of the John W. Carson
Foundation, EGPAF is able to further extend its reach and
services to children and mothers worldwide.
ViiV HEALTHCARE
ViiV Healthcare has been an instrumental partner in helping
EGPAF increase critical access to services for children living
with HIV. Through support from ViiV Healthcare’s Paediatric
Innovation Seed Fund, EGPAF has been able to expedite
access to HIV testing and care and treatment for infants
and young children in Lesotho, Malawi, and Swaziland.
This has resulted in children being diagnosed earlier and
enrolled in HIV treatment, care, and support programs.
ViiV Healthcare’s Positive Action for Children Fund (PACF)
has also invested in EGPAF as an implementing partner on
two projects: (1) Nakinae Akiyar, a program working with
nomadic communities in the Turkana region of Kenya to
improve their access to services for prevention of mother-
to-child transmission of HIV and early infant diagnosis
of HIV; and (2) Technical Assistance to Community-
based Organizations, an effort in Kenya and Malawi to
strengthen the technical and operational capacities of eight
community-based organizations.
PATTY AND GREG PENSKE
Patty and Greg Penske have been generous supporters of
the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation since 1989
when they contributed to A Night to Unite. Through their
company, Longo Toyota in El Monte, Calif., the Penskes
have sponsored EGPAF’s Los Angeles family event, A
Time for Heroes, each year since 1995. Their commitment
to supporting children and family services has advanced
EGPAF’s work of ensuring that every mother has access to
the knowledge and resources she needs to keep herself
alive and healthy and her children free of HIV.

SPECIAL
A TIME FOR HEROES
More than 1,000 parents and children gathered
on June 3, 2012, at the Wadsworth Theater Grounds
in Los Angeles, Calif., for A Time for Heroes.
Generously sponsored by The Walt Disney Company
and co-chaired by couples Willow Bay and Bob Iger
and Heather and Steve Mnuchin, the event raised
nearly $1 million in support of ending pediatric HIV
and AIDS worldwide.
Celebrity heroes in attendance included Gwen
Stefani, Sharon Stone, and Shailene Woodley. Singer/
songwriter Ingrid Michaelson delighted the crowd
with a special performance. Additional highlights were
an interactive Disney play area where kids built their
own toy cars, painted on the EGPAF “Make a Mother’s
Fight Your Fight” art wall, contributed to the ONE/
(RED) (2015) Digital AIDS Quilt, and rode a zip line
sponsored by Imagine Entertainment.
The event also included remarks by Jake Glaser and
by other EGPAF ambassadors who shared personal
stories of triumph over HIV. Their participation served
as a reminder of EGPAF’s history and of the global
impact it has had on the lives of children and families.
Since its launch in 1990, A Time for Heroes has raised
more than $34 million toward ending the transmission
of HIV from mother to child.
GLOBAL CHAMPIONS OF A MOTHER’S FIGHT
On Feb. 20, 2013, EGPAF hosted the inaugural
Global Champions of a Mother’s Fight awards dinner—
rescheduled from October 2012—to honor longtime leaders in
the fight to end pediatric AIDS. The New York City event brought
together more than 300 philanthropists, corporate leaders, and
members of the media committed to an AIDS-free generation.
The evening featured custom-designed decor by model Karlie
Kloss and designer Jason Wu, a globally inspired menu by
award-winning chef and Food Network star Cat Cora, and special
performances by Grammy-nominated recording artist Melanie
Fiona. Arianna Huffington, editor-in-chief of the Huffington Post
Media Group, kept the evening lively as master of ceremonies.
The dinner featured a thought-provoking panel discussion with
the honorees—Johnson & Johnson, represented by CEO Alex
Gorsky; Amy Robbins, founder of the Nduna Foundation; and
Cookie Johnson, philanthropist and board member of the Magic
Johnson Foundation. The awardees discussed global change,
innovation, and the possibility of a generation free of HIV and
AIDS. Attendees heard from EGPAF Board Co-chair Willow Bay,
EGPAF President and CEO Charles Lyons, and EGPAF Global
Ambassador Florence Ngobeni-Allen.
IN 2012, THE ELIZABETH GLASER PEDIATRIC AIDS FOUNDATION PLANNED TWO
HIGH-PROFILE EVENTS TO GATHER COMPASSIONATE DONORS AND RAISE
MUCH-NEEDED FUNDS FOR OUR MISSION AND WORK.
The 23rd annual A Time for Heroes celebrity picnic was held in Los Angeles in June. But nature intervened to blow EGPAF’s
second major event off the calendar. The inaugural Global Champions of a Mother’s Fight, scheduled to be held in New York
City in October, was postponed until February 2013 because of Hurricane Sandy.

EGPAF continues to ensure that most of every dollar
raised—88 cents in 2012—goes directly to programs to reach
as many children and families as possible. EGPAF’s financial
performance and accountability continue to be recognized
by leading charity rating organizations.
EGPAF’s newly formed affiliated organizations in Côte
d’Ivoire, Mozambique, and Tanzania have helped to increase
the resources dedicated to HIV prevention and care
and treatment programs in countries with high infection
rates. Although not included in EGPAF’s audited financial
statements, these three organizations—Fondation Ariel
Glaser Pour la Lutte Contre le SIDA Pédiatrique
(Côte d’Ivoire), Fundação Ariel Glaser Contra o SIDA
Pediátrico (Mozambique), and the Ariel Glaser Pediatric
AIDS Healthcare Initiative (Tanzania)—together spent
approximately $7.5 million in 2012.
Since its inception, EGPAF has been dedicated to raising
funds to prevent new pediatric AIDS infections and bring
hope to children and families living with HIV and AIDS.
These revenues represent the contributions of individuals,
corporations, foundations, and international organizations—
as well as ongoing support from the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the U.S. Agency
for International Development (USAID) through the U.S.
President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR).
EGPAF’s 2012 financial statements were prepared in
accordance with the United States generally accepted
accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). The complete audited
financial statements for EGPAF may be viewed on our

AFTER MORE THAN THREE DECADES OF THE AIDS PANDEMIC, TODAY WE
DARE TO IMAGINE THE END OF AIDS IN OUR LIFETIMES.
Across the world, children, mothers, and fathers living with HIV can now hope to celebrate many more birthdays. The number
of new infections is decreasing, and more people are receiving treatment to live longer, healthier lives. By stopping mother-
to-child transmission of the virus, we’ve virtually eliminated new cases of pediatric HIV in high-income countries. And over the
past decade we’ve made incredible progress in resource-poor areas of the world.
But prospects remain bleak for the babies of each expectant mother living with HIV who remains untreated. Each day,
hundreds of children acquire a deadly virus for which there is no cure. Without proper treatment, half of those children will die
before their second birthdays. We have the tools to save and change lives. With your continued support and generosity, we
know that we can achieve Elizabeth Glaser’s vision of a generation free from AIDS.
