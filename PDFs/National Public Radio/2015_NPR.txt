Dear Friends,
What a year it has been!
As we close the book on 2015, I look back proudly
on all that NPR has accomplished.
We grew broadcast audiences for Morning Edition
and All Things Considered on stations across the
country and reached new audiences through new
multiplatform offerings including Invisibilia, Hidden
Brain and our NPR Politics Podcast. Our news division
was recognized with some of the highest honors in
broadcasting, including two Alfred I. duPont Columbia
University Awards, a George Foster Peabody Award
and three Edward R. Murrow Awards from the Radio
Television Digital News Association. And for our
multichannel reach, NPR was named one of the top
10 agile U.S. brands by Landor Associates.
As the Iran nuclear talks were underway, Morning
Edition host Steve Inskeep sat down with President
Obama, Secretary of State John Kerry, Speaker of the
Iranian Parliament Ali Larijani, and Iranian President
Hassan Rouhani to provide our listeners with an even
greater understanding of what this deal entailed and
the possible outcomes its acceptance or rejection
might bring.
Our commitment to gathering news from around the
world has not faltered. The ongoing civil war in Syria,
the threat of ISIS, and the refugee crisis dominated
the headlines in 2015. Our correspondents in the
Middle East and Europe filed hundreds of reports not
only bringing the latest from the region but adding
the personal stories behind the conflict -- something
NPR does best. Following the terrorist attacks in
Paris, our news staff set up a base of operations there
to provide live, on-scene updates of a city reeling
from the devastation. Morning Edition host David
Greene and All Things Considered host Robert Siegel
anchored coverage, while correspondents Eleanor
Beardsley, Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson, Lauren Frayer
and Peter Kenyon reported on the ground. Our reach
abroad also expanded farther in early 2015 when NPR
opened its newest foreign news bureau, in Seoul,
South Korea, boosting our presence in Asia as the
region continues to change and grow.
As you may have noticed, our signature afternoon
program is now sporting some new, but familiar,
voices. This past September, Ari Shapiro and Kelly
McEvers joined Robert Siegel and Audie Cornish as
weekday hosts of All Things Considered, and Michel
Martin became the new weekend host of All Things
Considered. With new Executive Producers Carline
Watson and Kenya Young working behind the scenes,
this incredible lineup is bringing a fresh perspective
and reinvigorated energy to our evening drive time
and weekend listeners.
Our collaborations with Member stations continued
to expand this year with new initiatives that included
more local reporting in the areas of politics, energy
and the environment. A recent example of this
important partnership was the coverage leading up
to the climate change conference in Paris. Through
our collaborative initiative, we were able to inform
listeners not only of the broader issues surrounding
climate change but also of the effects of climate
change in local communities.
It is an exciting time for us at NPR and we could
not have done it without your support. You are our
advocates and our fans. You make us want to do
better -- to be the best. We are looking forward to
another great year, and we hope you are too.
Thank you for your generosity and for listening!

2 NPR 2015 Annual Report
Series: `Injured Nurses'
Impact: New inspections by the
Occupational Safety and Health
Administration
NPR Investigations' five-part "Injured Nurses"
series explored the debilitating and, in some
cases, career-ending musculoskeletal injuries
sustained by nurses charged with lifting increasingly
obese patients in unsafe ways. The investigation
found that many hospitals were doing little to
prevent these injuries, and government regulators,
who could force the hospitals to take action,
often weren't. The illuminating series earned
correspondent Daniel Zwerdling a March Sidney
Award from the Sidney Hillman Foundation, but,
perhaps more gratifyingly, prompted the federal
Occupational Safety and Health Administration to
institute a new inspection program. In an exclusive
on-air interview, OSHA's head, David Michaels,
acknowledged, "Hearing about the injuries facing
nurses in the NPR stories had an impact on us. ...The
stories helped motivate us to say, `What can we do?'
It's time for us to start some enforcement to make
sure fewer workers are hurt."
Impact At Home
National Public Radio will serve the individual; it will promote
personal growth; it will regard the individual differences among
men with respect and joy rather than derision and hate; it will
celebrate the human experience as infinitely varied rather than
vacuous and banal; it will encourage a sense of active constructive
participation, rather than apathetic helplessness. "
-- Bill Siemering, 1970
NPR's first programming director
3
Series: `World War II Secret
Mustard Gas Testing'
Impact: Acknowledgement of the
experiments by Congress and the
Department of Veterans Affairs
During World War II, thousands of American
servicemen were unwittingly exposed to mustard
gas in a series of secret experiments undertaken by
the U.S. military. The public first heard of these acts
in the 1990s, but Caitlin Dickerson's report exposed
much that had not been revealed. In eight months,
NPR's investigation uncovered 1,200 veterans who
had taken part in the experiments, compared with
just 610 that the Department of Veterans Affairs had
contacted in the previous 20 years. In response to the
story, the VA stated, "The NPR story rightfully points
out the sacrifices that veterans and their families
have gone through during the years when they
were sworn to secrecy. VA is prepared to assist any
veteran or survivor who contacts us in determining
their entitlement to benefits." In particular, the VA
requested the list of 1,200 veterans uncovered by
NPR. Lawmakers have promised to take action against
VA officials, and a bipartisan group in Congress has
called on Defense Secretary Ash Carter to apologize
to veterans used in the race-based experiments.
In November, NPR published the first searchable
database of men exposed to mustard gas testing.
It comprised 3,700 names and counting.
The ideals set forth in NPR's mission statement were held high
in 2015. Through groundbreaking reporting and fresh approaches to
reaching new listeners, NPR journalists stayed committed to getting to
the heart of every story, often in unwelcoming environments. Several
reports went on to affect major changes in public policy. That's serving
the individual. And making an impact.
4 NPR 2015 Annual Report
Series: `The American
Red Cross'
Impact: Call for greater accountability
As part of NPR's strategic aspiration to be
"the model for high-quality journalism ...
strengthening the cultural, civic, and social
fabric of our democracy," NPR and ProPublica
looked into the performance of the American
Red Cross, both in terms of how it handled
Superstorm Sandy and in the earthquake relief
efforts in Haiti. The reports prompted Sen.
Charles Grassley and Rep. Rick Nolan, among
others, to seek more information from American
Red Cross CEO Gail McGovern.
Series: `A Closer Look
At Sexual Assaults
On Campus'
Impact: Much-needed awareness
Over the course of five months and 21 revealing
stories, NPR took an unflinching look at the
problem of sexual assault on college campuses,
a crime reported by only a small percentage
of victims. This difficult subject was approached
from all angles -- political, educational, legal and
medical -- illuminating a dark and complex corner
of our society. Stories ranged from the ability of
smartphone apps to combat attacks to the history
behind sexual assault politics. But whether narrow
or wide in focus, the stories combined to bring
much needed attention to voices that are often
silenced. The importance of the coverage
was recognized with a Gracie Award for
Outstanding Series.
5
Ongoing Coverage:
Race In America
Impact: Sparking difficult conversations
2015 was a painful reminder of many of the
worst moments in America's racial history.
There were the deaths of African-Americans in
police encounters that sparked anger and civil
unrest, and the killing of nine worshippers at a
South Carolina church by a white supremacist.
NPR not only covered these events in signature
fashion but created multiple opportunities for
audiences to gain perspective and engage in
conversations on race relations.
Steve Inskeep's four on-camera interviews with
President Obama are a case in point. The third
of the interviews took place on the one-year
anniversary of Michael Brown's death in Ferguson,
Mo., and elicited poignant commentary from the
president on the topic of race relations in America.
Michel Martin led important conversations with
Member stations in St. Louis, Los Angeles and
Montgomery, Ala., on community and policing
and the future of the civil rights movement in
connection with the 60th anniversary of the
Montgomery bus boycott.
In an unprecedented
collaborative effort,
NPR, along with Member
stations WUNC, KSTX,
KUOW, KAZU, WLPR,
KPBS and WBUR, presented a special
series of reports chronicling the lives
of America's troops where they live.
The series, "Back at Base," kicked off
with a KPBS report about Marines
commemorating the 10th anniversary
of the battle for Fallujah. WLPR's Steve
Walsh reported on the negative effects
the Veterans Choice program has had
on veterans living within 40 miles of a
VA clinic. The story prompted the VA
to change its implementation of the 40-
mile rule. Other highlights from "Back at
Base" included several in-depth accounts
of women in combat -- putting NPR's
coverage ahead of the curve when the
Pentagon formally admitted women to
all fighting positions in December.
6 NPR 2015 Annual Report
Ongoing Coverage:
Ebola
Impact: Exigency for a global
strategy to combat the outbreak
Amid the sensationalism surrounding the Ebola
crisis in 2014, NPR's coverage stood out as
calm, measured and informative -- the kind
of reporting that can only come from having
journalists on the ground witnessing a complex
situation firsthand. NPR stories informed world
health organizations and drew attention to
the need for a global strategy to combat the
outbreak. The collaborative effort among more
than 100 NPR network and Member station
journalists strategically positioned in crisis
locations around the world resulted in the filing
of over 200 stories and garnered NPR its 62nd
Peabody Award.
But while the crisis may have subsided from
the headlines in 2015, it continued in the most
ravaged parts of West Africa. And so did
NPR's coverage. Stories from survivors, family
members, health care workers and journalists
painted a clear portrait of devastated
communities and continued suffering -- but
also one of compassion, heroism and hope,
particularly for a vaccine to end the misery.
A vaccine that, as NPR reported in July,
looks to have been discovered.
Impact
Abroad
7
As news surfaced of the first Ebola patient in the U.S., Member station KERA in
Dallas provided in-depth, front-line coverage that became a beacon of trust in
a sea of panic and misinformation. Its audio and interactive series "Surviving
Ebola" continued the story from other perspectives -- the mistakes made,
lessons learned, and lives changed.
8 NPR 2015 Annual Report
Series: `Cuba's New Era:
Stories From Havana'
Impact: Clearer understanding of
an often misunderstood nation
As the U.S. and Cuba moved to normalize
diplomatic relations, NPR's Robert Siegel,
reporting from Havana for a six-part series,
shed light on a nation hitherto unwilling, or
unable, to show its true colors. Whether at a
square in the middle of Havana, at a baseball
game, in the makeshift home of a single mother
and her kids in a poor neighborhood, or inside a
1955 Chevy Bel Air, Siegel's narrative storytelling
connected listeners with vibrant scenes. Voices
of dissent, artists and musicians openly criticized
the Cuban regime. In an exclusive interview,
performance artist Tania Bruguera discussed in
detail how her attempt to perform in Revolution
Square in December led to the seizure of her
passport, detainment and imprisonment. Other
stories debated the future of private sector
investment, the possibility of the U.S. doing
business with the island, and the hopes for
improved Internet access. To complement
Siegel's vivid and sound-rich pieces on air,
Eyder Peralta documented the trip on NPR's
On the Road Tumblr with captivating
photographs and back story.
Ongoing Coverage: Syria
Impact: Illuminating the plight of
refugees
If the world had one major focal point in 2015,
it was Syria. What started out as a contained
civil war soon became a full-blown, multifaceted
international crisis. As ISIS fighters terrorized the
region, NPR reports shed much needed light on the
complex political quagmire that embroiled
both neighbors and superpowers, as well as the
personal suffering of countless refugees. While
more than 4 million Syrians fled their homeland,
NPR narrowed its lens and focused on specific
exiles' accounts to paint a larger geopolitical
picture. A series of ear-opening reports detailed
lost dreams, assimilation into strange cultures, why
the U.S. was accepting so few refugees, and why
one of the lucky ones who made it to the U.S. was
intent on returning to his ravaged homeland. For
one story, NPR correspondents Ari Shapiro and
Joanna Kakissis followed Monzer Omar, a teacher
and father of two, as he made his way from the
Turkish coast through Greece, Macedonia, Serbia
and finally to Central Europe in search of a new
home. Another account, Melissa Block's deeply
personal interview with refugee Soufian Almobark,
moved the conductor of the Iowa City West
Choirs-West Singers so much that he incorporated
excerpts of it into a performance.
9
Series: `#15Girls'
Impact: Understanding challenges
teenage girls face around the world
In October, NPR's multiplatform "#15Girls"
appeared on NPR newsmagazines, on the
Goats and Soda blog and on social media
under the hashtag #15Girls. The series explored
the lives of 15-year-old girls and one boy around
the world fighting to change their futures in
the face of strictly enforced rules and long-held
traditions. On radio and online, NPR audiences
engaged with a diverse range of stories, from girls
in El Salvador who live in constant fear of gang
violence to a teenager in Nepal who has to sleep
in a shed every time she gets her period to a Syrian
straight-A student forced to give up high school to
pick potatoes. The series included a listening party
of 40 girls and women hosted by Generation Listen
at NPR's headquarters and appealed to younger
readers and listeners by asking them to share their
own stories. The question posed on social media
-- "What's the hardest thing about being 15?" --
elicited more than 1,000 answers.
Series: `The Rain Forest
Was Here'
Impact: Raising awareness of the
effects of deforestation in three
languages
As part of NPR's environmental coverage leading
up to the Paris climate change conference in
December, South American correspondent Lourdes
Garcia-Navarro traveled to the Amazon for a closer
look at deforestation -- not just the economic,
social and political reasons for why it happens but
its increasingly dire effect on the region's fragile
rain forest ecosystem. The five-part series aired
on Morning Edition and was complemented by a
revealing NPR Visuals explainer on deforestation,
made available in English, Spanish and Portuguese.
The Modern Post referred to the NPR Visual team's
slideshow as "a wonderful examiner on the death
of the Amazon rain forest." The series was also
referenced widely on Twitter and in news sources
across the U.S. and Latin America.
NPR 2015 Annual Report
Online And On The Go
In November, Landor
released a study that named
NPR one of the 10 Most Agile
Brands in the U.S. and ranked
it highest among media organizations.
The study highlighted NPR for its successes
across platforms including NPR.org, NPR
One, social media and podcasting. NPR
One was also named a finalist in both Fast
Company's Innovation by Design Awards
and, along with NPR.org, the "World's
Best-Designed" category in the Society of
News Design's fifth annual Best of Digital
Design Competition. Jacobs Media named
NPR One "Radio's Most Innovative."
NPR continued its digital innovation on several fronts in 2015, expanding the way
we deliver our signature storytelling and engaging our audience in new ways.
10
11
NPR One
NPR One continued delivering hand-picked stories
based on listeners' tastes. In addition to its many
design awards, it was one of the few apps available
on the initial iWatch interface. There are more
than 100 Member stations currently contributing
content to NPR One, helping the app deliver
the best combined local and national news
experience anywhere.
NPR.org
Already one of the fastest websites in the news
industry, NPR.org this year doubled its load speed.
With 25 million unique visitors to the site each
month, the majority of them accessing it via
phones and tablets, the upgrade furthers public
radio's commitment to mobile audiences. NPR
technologists also improved user experiences
across nearly all NPR.org pages, including articles,
section fronts and the home page. Other highlights
include updated audio players embedded in the
site, making it easier to share content on social
media; an upgraded search engine that helps users
find stories more quickly; a new podcast directory;
more visible station co-branding; more accessible
sponsorship opportunities; and a refined, mobile-
friendly tool to connect users directly with their
local Member stations. And to make NPR.org more
accessible to visitors with limited vision or mobility,
NPR developers added screen-reading software
throughout the site to allow for swifter navigation.
All of these changes are a significant contribution to
NPR's nonprofit mission to create a more informed
public -- now at faster speeds.
The Two-Way
On June 26, Bill Chappell's Two-Way blog post
broke the news about the Supreme Court's
historic decision declaring same-sex marriage
legal in all 50 states. In the process, it reached
13 million people on Facebook -- more than any
other media organization. The post got more than
60,000 impressions on the day the news broke, far
exceeding the usual 30,000 to 40,000. This was
thanks in part to Chappell's in-depth, insightful
coverage of the ruling, delivered just minutes after
the decision was reached.
NPR One offers
greater collaboration
opportunities with
Member stations by
combining news from
NPR with stations' own
stories and podcasts.
12 NPR 2015 Annual Report
The Podcast Comes Of Age
Podcasts provide another opportunity for collaboration, and some of NPR's
most successful are produced in partnership with Member stations. Wait,
Wait...Don't Tell Me! from NPR and WBEZ in Chicago and Fresh Air from
WHYY in Philadelphia are just two of many examples.
August marked 10 years of podcasting for NPR, and in that decade the medium has
exploded. The format has proved to be a beautiful match for the high-quality storytelling
that is at the core of NPR's DNA. Today, the enthusiasm from listeners is matched only by
our commitment to providing them with more quality content. Pioneering NPR podcast
hits such as TED Radio Hour, Fresh Air and Planet Money were joined in 2015 by Invisibilia,
Hidden Brain and the NPR Politics Podcast. In December, five of the top podcasts on the
iTunes top 10 chart were those of NPR or an NPR Member station.
13
Invisibilia
From its very first episode in January, the success of NPR's Invisibilia was
easy to see. The series, about the invisible forces that control human behavior,
debuted at No. 1 on the podcast charts, beating out the hugely successful
Serial, while also simultaneously airing on over 400 Member stations around
the country. All in all, the show, hosted by Lulu Miller and Alix Spiegel, was
met with applause: The Columbia Journalism Review named the series one
of the best pieces of journalism in 2015; iTunes included it in its Best of 2015
picks; and The Guardian ranked the show as its No. 5 podcast of the year.
The hit program will resume in June 2016 with a second season and the
addition of a third host -- author Hanna Rosin.
Hidden Brain
Hidden Brain, a podcast about the unconscious patterns that drive human
behavior, hit 2.2 million downloads barely one month after its release in late
September. In fact, it became the No. 2 podcast on iTunes even before its
official release. A sneak-peek episode reached 192,000 downloads, topping
the iTunes chart. Hosted by NPR science correspondent Shankar Vedantam,
Hidden Brain has been downloaded in over 125 countries. In anticipation of
the launch, NPR held its first-ever social media meetup at NPR headquarters
in Washington, D.C., during which #HiddenBrain trended at No. 1 on Twitter.
NPR Politics Podcast
A timely addition to NPR's podcast offerings, the NPR Politics Podcast
launched in November and promises to continue a long tradition of using
election coverage as grounds for experimentation in storytelling and
technology. For the 2016 election, NPR has created three new beats, with
Asma Khalid covering demography and identity, Scott Detrow reporting on
technology and data, and Sam Sanders covering culture and pop culture.
Working equally well in both digital and radio spaces, they will provide
another avenue for reaching our audience members where they are.
The NPR Politics Podcast is proving to be a medium that lends itself to
different kinds of discussions. As one unsolicited but enthusiastic listener
proclaimed, "This show is a breath of fresh air in the din of mainstream
political coverage and `analysis.' "
earbud.fm
Launched in October by the NPR Arts, Books & Culture desk, NPR's
earbud.fm offers visitors a friendly guide to great podcasts. The site
curates more than 200 podcasts hand-picked by listeners, podcast and
radio creators, and celebrities. By allowing users to sort through
recommendations and select the categories that most interest them,
earbud.fm makes it easy for listeners to discover new podcasts. With
new series and episodes being added all the time, it is yet another platform
that allows NPR to meet its listeners in the places, at the times and through
the channels most convenient to them.
14 NPR 2015 Annual Report
NPR Takes The Stage
Michel Martin: Going There
Throughout 2015, Michel Martin, weekend host of All Things
Considered, took the studio to the story. In collaboration with
Member stations across the country, Michel Martin: Going There
held live and lively conversations on topics as varied as the ethics
of football, presented in conjunction with KERA in Dallas, and
immigration, in partnership with WLRN in Miami. With WDET in
Detroit, the discussion centered on the role artists are playing in
moving the city forward. In New Orleans with WWNO, it focused
on what school officials and communities are doing to reinvent
the school system 10 years after Katrina. Martin's "Streets and
Beats" conversation in Los Angeles, in conjunction with Member
station KPCC, continued that city's ongoing discussion on race
and police brutality and brought together former gang members,
artists, the clergy and law enforcement to dispel misconceptions
and advance a more meaningful dialogue. Responses to a Twitter
callout for questions took the conversation to an even deeper
level. Martin also discussed the youth vote with teenagers in
Iowa, together with Iowa Public Radio, and 60 years after the
Montgomery bus boycott she examined the current state of race
relations in Alabama, in partnership with WVAS.
Guests and audience members alike contributed to these dynamic discussions and live Twitter chats as
each event brought these local stories to a national audience, further confirming the importance of social
media in expanding NPR's reach. The series attracted audiences that were 50 percent younger and more
diverse than those at other NPR live events.
Already a growing presence on digital and mobile platforms, this year NPR expanded
its efforts to connect with listeners face to face through NPR Presents. And our
audience responded, filling seats in theaters and intimate spaces across the country
for entertaining, thought-provoking live events. Whether it's a musical performance,
comedy quiz show, dissection of current events or in-depth discussion of more
personal topics, fans are lining up to see the faces behind familiar voices and
experience NPR in a whole new way.
15
Family Matters
In collaboration with Member stations, Family
Matters, a live personal finance discussion series,
connected audiences with a panel of experts for
invaluable conversations about money. Led by NPR
Morning Edition host David Greene, along with
business correspondent Yuki Noguchi and business
reporter Sonari Glinton, discussions in Buffalo, N.Y.,
Albany, N.Y., Stony Brook, N.Y., Pittsburgh and New
Haven, Conn., featured multigenerational audiences
and centered on their differing financial concerns.
The NPR panel offered examples, often personal,
of both right and wrong ways to manage wealth,
student debt, retirement and other money issues.
nprpresents.org
In keeping with NPR's commitment to taking public
radio out of the studio and into intimate spaces
around the country, we launched nprpresents.org
in August. With just a few clicks or taps, our
audience can now learn about all of our upcoming
live events and buy tickets. From music to comedy
to in-depth conversations about the topics that
affect us all, NPR Presents makes it easier than ever
to be at that not-to-be-missed event.
NPR Music
To bring fans closer to music they love and
generate new material, NPR Music hosted more
concerts and live events than ever before in 2015.
In the process, it found fresh, new ways to reach
and engage these listeners. Highlights of the busy
12 months included a special live recording of
Microphone Check, in partnership with WABE in
Atlanta, that featured the pioneers and current
players of that city's singular legacy within the
hip-hop culture. In June, NPR Music brought
Grammy Award­winning recording artist Miguel
to the stage for a First Listen Live performance.
Those unable to attend the free concert in New
York were able to enjoy a live webcast of the
entire show. Prior to the annual live webcast of
the Americana Music Association's Honors and
Awards ceremony, NPR Music critic Ann Powers
hosted an event with daytime performances by
Rhiannon Giddens, Patty Griffin and Shakey Graves.
In October, Grammy Award­winning producer,
songwriter and recording artist Pharrell Williams
made a lot of people happy when he sat down for
a rare in-depth interview with Jason King, host of
NPR Music's R&B initiative I'll Take You There. The
interview was offered up to NPR Music community
members via social media.
16 NPR 2015 Annual Report
Tiny Desk
Concert Contest
Following on the success of the
Tiny Desk Concert series, NPR Music
held a contest offering an artist or
group the chance to perform at
America's most famous desk. Entries,
of which there were close to 7,000,
featured each artist performing an
original song at a desk of his or
her choosing. The videos were
uploaded to YouTube and submitted
to NPR.org. The top prize was
claimed by Fantastic Negrito, but
the real winners may have been
listeners of NPR Member stations,
including WILL in Urbana, which
showcased local Illinois entries on
its website, and WHRO in Norfolk,
Va., which hosted its own Tiny Desk
contest. Eager fans were able to
keep track of updates and new
entries online using the hashtag
#TinyDeskContest.
New Approaches,
New Audiences
With news and entertainment now on every device, and new apps and social media
platforms emerging every day, audiences have a growing number of listening
opportunities from which to choose. 2015 saw NPR launch more innovative, successful
efforts to engage both new and current listeners. There were contests fueled by social
media. Book clubs and listening parties. Deeper collaboration with Member stations.
In a year of highlights, several of these efforts stood out.
17
Generation Listen Listening Tour
Generation Listen, a movement to connect NPR with younger audiences,
grew throughout the country this year, thanks in part to an experimental
gathering held at NPR West in January. Listeners were alerted via Facebook
to a listening party that would be held that night to celebrate the launch of
Invisibilia. The Generation Listen team wanted to see what would happen
if 15 to 20 people got together to listen to NPR programming the way
friends might gather to watch a movie. Upon welcoming a roomful of eager
participants, the team discovered just how hungry people are to connect in
person and engage in meaningful conversation.
Generation Listen wanted to share this experience far and wide, so in
May, the team hit the road to co-host informal listening parties with
Member stations across the South. Highlights of the nine-city trip included
a sold-out Microphone Check event in collaboration with WABE in Atlanta
and a Songs We Love Live event hosted by Audie Cornish at the NPR
headquarters in Washington. In addition to introducing new audiences
to podcasts like Invisibilia and TED Radio Hour, the gatherings succeeded
in deepening relationships with local stations and young listeners alike.
Fans were able to follow the tour on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.
Morning Edition Book Club
Launched at the end of 2014, the
Morning Edition book club consists of
well-known authors choosing a book
for discussion and dissection. Listeners
are then invited to read the book and
submit questions. A month later, both
the selecting author and the writer
of the book talk about the story and
answer listener questions on air. To
date, participants have included
best-selling authors Ann Patchett, Gillian Flynn and Richard Russo. Texas
Public Radio, WVXU, WUGA, KGOU and KMUW have each hosted their own
clubs, and WAMU put on a sold-out event in Washington, D.C., in November.
Generation Listen's
Listening Tour is
a prime example
of ongoing efforts
to engage current
audiences while
bringing in new
listeners. It's also
a good example
of collaboration
between NPR and
Member stations.
Stations that
participated include
KRTS in Marfa,
Texas; WWNO in
New Orleans; WBHM
in Birmingham, Ala.;
WUWF in Pensacola,
Fla.; Georgia Public
Broadcasting and
WABE in Atlanta;
and WFDD in
Winston-Salem, N.C.
18 NPR 2015 Annual Report
Looking Forward
To 2016
For all the new ground that was broken in 2015, 2016 is shaping up to
have its own share of milestones. The 2016 presidential election will also
see NPR join forces with PBS NewsHour for the first-ever joint convention
coverage, with one team of journalists and one broadcast designed to
work seamlessly across radio, television and digital platforms. This joint
coverage will leverage the work of journalists in more than 200 public radio
newsrooms and PBS stations across the country. 2016 will also see the
introduction of an enhanced audio player on NPR.org. And listeners can
look forward to a second season of the immensely popular Invisibilia, as
well as new podcasts, including one in which All Things Considered host
Kelly McEvers takes a story from the news and follows it wherever it goes.
A Word About You
Specifically, thanks. 2015 could not have been so successful, nor the
promise of 2016 so exciting, without the continuing support of you, the
NPR listener. Whether you donate, sponsor, listen in the car, read online
