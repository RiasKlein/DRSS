LETTER
FROM OUR
CO-CHAIRMEN
It has been a challenging time for the risk reduction agenda.
We saw renewed global attention and progress on reducing the
nuclear threat as a result of the third Nuclear Security Summit in the
Netherlands, but we also saw serious setbacks to crucial cooperation
between the United States, Europe and Russia because of the troubling
and dangerous developments in eastern Ukraine.
These developments, however, underscore the importance of our mission
and inspire us to keep working.
Fifty-three world leaders attended the March 2014 summit in the
Netherlands. Together, they recognized the shared responsibility of the
nuclear security mission and called for key elements of a global nuclear
materials security system that would hold all states accountable to
international standards and best practices.
This outcome is especially positive from our perspective. We have
worked since 2012 to promote a global system to secure all materials,
to employ international standards and best practices, to give states
the capacity to assess nuclear security globally and hold each other
accountable, and to develop consensus among world leaders on how the
system would work. The Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI) worked closely
with the Dutch hosts, along with other governments, to advance this
“

IMPORTANT TO OUR
WORK. IN FACT, IT’S A
VERY POWERFUL 
EXAMPLE OF THE WAYS
IN WHICH THOSE 
WHO GENERATE IDEAS 
CAN HAVE A REAL 
IMPACT ON POLICY.”

agenda in the build-up to the 2014 summit. We are pleased that there is
broader understanding of the need for a global system, and the concept
now has the momentum to build wider support and implementation by
the 2016 Nuclear Security Summit in the United States.
Also positive from our perspective, many countries at the Netherlands
Summit used the NTI Nuclear Materials Security Index to mark their
progress and make new security commitments. Released in January
2014, the second edition of the NTI Index offers a public assessment
of nuclear materials security conditions in 176 countries. Our top
recommendation—the need for a global system—was supported by
strong editorials in both The New York Times and The Washington Post.
CRISIS IN UKRAINE
In early 2014, Russia took over Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula. In
addition to creating urgent dangers, the crisis further frayed relations
between Russia and the West and undermined cooperation on our
nuclear agenda.
These destabilizing events underscored the need for a new approach
to Euro-Atlantic security, which was the subject of NTI’s 2013 report,
Building Mutual Security in the Euro-Atlantic Region by NTI board
members Des Browne, Igor Ivanov and Sam Nunn, along with former
German Deputy Foreign Minister Wolfgang Ischinger. Briefed to top
Russian, European and U.S. leaders, the report takes up the pivotal
question of the post–Cold War era: How can Russia, the United States
and Europe overcome the historical animosities of the Cold War and
move decisively toward a new security strategy for the 21st century?
Though written before Ukraine erupted, the report includes medium-
and long-term approaches that we believe can contribute to solutions
for the region.
Forty bishops, policy specialists, Catholic
scholars and students explored policy and
moral challenges in moving toward a world
without nuclear weapons at a colloquium
supported by NTI.

CREATING NEW MOMENTUM
At a time when governments are increasingly stuck in status quo
policies, NTI has fostered action by states and organizations to reduce
nuclear dangers. For example, in November 2013, NTI organized
a meeting in Singapore with more than 30 high-profile global leaders
from five continents to outline steps to develop consensus on
responding to nuclear dangers. The meeting of members from four
regional leadership networks supported by our Nuclear Security Project
helped foster a sense of urgency to address nuclear issues.
We are heartened by the energy behind the series of global conferences
on the humanitarian consequences of the use of nuclear weapons. As Dr.
Patricia Lewis of Chatham House has written, “The fact that it has taken
decades to discuss the problems [nuclear weapons] create through a
humanitarian framework demonstrates how adept our societies are at
forgetting, disguising, and denying the overwhelming and the terrify-
ing.” NTI’s ongoing support for the faith community’s important voice on
these issues dovetails with these current moral and ethical discussions.
ACHIEVING GOALS IN BIOSECURITY
NTI realized one of our priority goals to address the biological threat—
establishing a global disease surveillance network to boost the world’s
ability for rapid detection and response to infectious disease outbreaks,
whether natural or intentional. In January 2013, the new network, called
CORDS (Connecting Organizations for Disease Surveillance), was
launched as an independent organization, with significant support from
the Rockefeller Foundation, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and
the Skoll Global Threats Fund. Today, CORDS is helping its member
networks prepare for and manage the Ebola threat in Africa and
throughout the world.
The 2014 NTI Nuclear Materials Security
Index called for global action to secure
dangerous materials from terrorists.

PLANNING FOR OUR FUTURE
In March of 2014, NTI board member and former UK Defense Minister
Des Browne agreed to serve as NTI vice chairman. Des, together
with NTI Chief Executive Officer Sam Nunn and Joan Rohlfing, NTI’s
president, will help guide NTI’s long-term strategic direction and build
NTI’s institutional sustainability.
The road we are on—to reverse reliance on nuclear weapons globally
as a vital contribution to preventing their proliferation into potentially
dangerous hands, and ultimately ending them as a threat to the world
—is sometimes filled with moments of exhilaration and at other times,
discouragement. Whether the day’s news is bright or dark, we are
dedicated to reducing global threats and risks. We are encouraged by
the positive and powerful impact of NTI and our tangible achievements.
We owe much to our supporters, who have put their faith in us. We want
to thank all of our funders, in particular our longstanding supporters
Warren Buffett, Carnegie Corporation of New York, the John D. and
Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, Peter G. Peterson Foundation and
George Russell. We also appreciate the thousands of individuals globally
who support us with their words of encouragement and their
contributions. We are honored and inspired to be your partners in
building a safer world.

NUCLEAR TERRORISM:
INTEREST AND ACCESS
Al Qaeda has repeatedly tried
to purchase nuclear material or
weapons. U.S. Secretary of Defense
Chuck Hagel called the Al-Qaeda
inspired group Islamic State,
also known as ISIS and ISIL, “as
sophisticated and well-funded as
any organization we’ve seen.”
(2,000)
metric tons of weapons-usable
nuclear materials are stored at
hundreds of sites around the world—
some poorly guarded and vulnerable.

STEWARDSHIP
(2012)
In 2012 an 82-year-old nun and two
others broke into the main U.S.
storage vault for weapons-usable
highly enriched uranium, spending
two hours inside before they
were caught.
(in2013and2014)
the Associated Press described a
“string of recent training failures,
security missteps, leadership lapses,
morale problems and stunning
breakdowns in discipline” among
Air Force nuclear personnel.
CYBER THREAT
(in 2013)
Air Force Gen. C. Robert Kehler,
then-head of America’s nuclear
forces, said he was
“veryconcerned
with the potential of a cyber-related
attack on our nuclear command-
and-control system, or on the
weapons themselves.”
THE INDIA–PAKISTAN
NUCLEAR RIVALRY
These nuclear–armed nations
harbor long-held hostilities, have
fought each other in numerous
wars and continue to face a bitter
territorial dispute. India has faced
significant terrorist attacks, and in an
unprecedented attack
(in 2014)
the Taliban stormed the airport
in Pakistan’s capital.
NEW NUCLEAR POWER
(more than 30)
countries want nuclear power.
But making fuel for nuclear power plants
involves the same technology as making
materials for nuclear weapons. Without
action to reduce proliferation and security risks,
more countries could be like Iran,
onthebrink
of being able to build nuclear weapons.

The solution: Secure all weapons-
usable nuclear materials. Remove
them from vulnerable locations.
Eliminate them, where possible.
Work for a global system that
ensures all countries have effective
security in place.
Securing vulnerable nuclear
materials has been a priority for
NTI since our founding. In 2013,
much of our work focused on
providing advice and support to
governments participating in the
2014 Nuclear Security Summit,
held in March. Fifty-three world
leaders attended the event, and
many countries made new
commitments to secure dangerous
nuclear materials and prevent
them from ending up in the hands
of terrorists.
NTI’s work followed two tracks:
a public initiative that focused
worldwide attention on the status
of nuclear materials security and a
behind-the-scenes effort to shape
Summit agendas and outcomes.
In January 2014, NTI published the
second edition of the NTI Nuclear
Materials Security Index—a public
accounting of nuclear materials
security conditions in 176 countries.
The NTI Index highlighted progress
since 2012 and reported on seven
countries that had removed all or
most of their stocks of weapons-
usable nuclear materials. Global
coverage included both The New
York Times and Washington Post
editorial boards voicing support
The rise of the Islamic State, known as
ISIS or ISIL, reignites fears of terrorist
access to nuclear materials or weapons.
for NTI’s top recommendation—
to develop a system of global
standards and best practices for
securing nuclear materials. Also
gratifying, many countries used
the NTI Index at the summit to
mark their progress and make new
commitments.
If an important goal of the Index
is to highlight the need for a
global system, the purpose of
NTI’s Global Dialogue on Nuclear 
Security Priorities is to help design
it, then make it a reality. The Global
Dialogue brought together
officials and experts from around
the world to develop a consen-
sus on what an effective system
should look like.

IT IS TIME FOR A NEW APPROACH. GOVERNMENTS
CAN NO LONGER ACT IN ISOLATION, AS THOUGH
NUCLEAR SECURITY WERE EXCLUSIVELY A
‘SOVEREIGN’ RESPONSIBILITY.”
—Joan Rohlfing
The Hague Communiqué issued at the conclusion of the Summit
called for a strengthened and comprehensive international nuclear
security architecture, reflecting key principles developed through
NTI’s Global Dialogue process. The idea for a global system now has
growing momentum and support from key countries to widen
implementation ahead of the 2016 summit in the United States.
LOOKING AHEAD
As what may be the final Nuclear Security Summit approaches in 2016,
NTI will continue to work with governments to turn the consensus on
key principles of a global nuclear security system into action.

In March 2013, the four NSP
principals published the fifth in
a series of op-eds in The Wall
Street Journal, calling for urgent
attention to the nuclear threat and
outlining key areas for President
Obama and world leaders to
address. Recommendations
included:
l 
Securing nuclear material to
prevent catastrophic nuclear
terrorism, citing the need for a
comprehensive global materials
security system.
l 
Changes in “prompt launch”
posture to increase decision
time for leaders. The
United States should work
with nuclear-armed nations
worldwide to remove all nuclear
weapons from prompt launch
status.
l 
Following up the New START
treaty by examining whether to
go below New START levels
for warheads and launchers,
guided by strict reciprocity and
demonstrable verification and
with adequate and stable
funding for our nuclear arsenal.
The United States and Russia
should also consolidate and
reduce their stockpiles of tactical
nuclear weapons.
l 
A new verification and
transparency initiative should
involve U.S. nuclear weapons
laboratories and global scientif-
ic experts developing essential
technologies and innovations
for reducing and controlling
nuclear weapons and materials.
The principle of enhanced
transparency could also be
applied to missile defense.
l 
A joint enterprise. The Nuclear
Security Summits could provide
a model for leaders to create a
joint enterprise with common
objectives to achieve progress
on specific steps.
The op-ed received widespread
attention in the media, in the
Twitterverse, and among decision-
makers. President Obama’s June
2013 speech in Berlin reflected
themes from the op-ed.

As NATO navigates how to cooperate
with Russia in times of crisis, NTI’s

GATHERING GLOBAL
NETWORKS
In 2013, the NSP helped form new
regional networks in Latin America
and the United States. Like groups
in Asia and Europe, members
include high-profile current and
former officials committed to a
world without nuclear weapons
and the steps to achieve it. The
NSP now supports regional
networks on five continents which
lead dialogue, outreach and action
on nuclear issues.
In November, NTI gathered
members from all the regional
networks in Singapore. The first-
of-its-kind meeting included
30 leaders and experts from 20
countries and was hosted by
Shultz, Perry and Nunn. “This
meeting is historic—demonstrating
in thought and action how nuclear
weapons and proliferation issues
must be tackled seriously and
cooperatively by countries around
the world,” Shultz observed.
Our work with analytical partners
also continued. Policy institutions
worldwide are exploring political
and technical questions related to
the vision and steps. In 2013, the
NSP created a new relationship
with the Arab Institute for Security
Studies in Jordan.

of his experiences in the
nuclear weapons arena, from
advising the White House
during the Cuban Missile
Crisis to serving in 
the Clinton Administration. 
He describes how those 
experiences shaped his
thinking and led him to 
dedicate his career to 
reducing the dangers of 

working for their ultimate
elimination.
In addition, Perry is 
developing educational 

and experts from Europe, Russia
and the United States.
The authors address the most
significant obstacle to regional
cooperation: a corrosive lack
of trust, fueled by historical
animosities and uncertainties
in the European and global
security landscape. They propose
integrated dialogue and action in
six areas—nuclear forces, missile
defenses, prompt-strike forces,
conventional forces, cybersecurity
and space—with specific steps to
reduce dangers.
The report was released in English
and Russian and distributed
among officials at the highest
levels of government in the United
States, Russia and Europe. In
September, the co-chairs traveled
to Brussels to present the report to
senior NATO officials and national
delegations. Events in Ukraine
underscore the need for a new
approach to Euro-Atlantic security,
and the authors are committed to
continue working toward solutions.
INNOVATING VERIFICATION:
NEW TOOLS & NEW ACTORS
TO REDUCE NUCLEAR RISKS
At a time when a path forward on
arms control is hard to envision,
NTI partnered with senior leaders
from the U.S. Departments of
Defense, Energy and State and the
governments of Norway, Sweden
and the United Kingdom to
identify areas that could help lay
groundwork for deep reductions in
nuclear weapons globally. Among
the challenges:
l 
Key players are excluded from
some verification arrangements,
or in some cases, do not yet
have the necessary expertise to
participate.
l 
No mechanism exists for
accounting for individual
warheads or for all weapons-
usable nuclear material.
l 
Advances in big data and
information analysis create an
opportunity to shed light on
key verification activities and
developments but are untested
and not yet tailored to the
nuclear mission.
To address these issues, NTI’s
Verification Pilot Project created
three working groups with more
than 40 technical and policy
experts from a dozen countries.
Their report series, Innovating
Verification: New Tools & New
Actors to Reduce Nuclear Risks,
was published in mid-2014.

In 2013, NTI co-led the formal
launch of CORDS (Connecting
Organizations for Regional Disease
Surveillance), an organization
dedicated to improving disease
surveillance worldwide, at a
premier international public
health conference held annually in
Thailand.
NTI cultivated CORDS from a
pilot program into a unique,
international non-governmental
organization that links disease
surveillance networks in different
regions of the world. CORDS
today has the support of the
World Health Organization WHO,
the World Organization for
Animal Health and the Food and
Animal Organization of the United
Nations. As David Rockefeller
noted at the CORDS launch,
“Together, we are once again
proving the power of original
thinking, close collaboration
across disciplines and borders,
and a determined commitment
to solutions.”
The Rockefeller Foundation,
along with the Bill & Melinda
Gates Foundation and the Skoll
Global Threats Fund, is supporting
CORDS as an independent
organization.
MIDDLE EAST NETWORK:
PROGRESS AMID TENSION
NTI created and continues
to support the Middle East
Consortium for Infectious Disease
Surveillance (MECIDS). Formed in
2003, when cooperative efforts in
the region were scarce, MECIDS
includes participation from
Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian
Authority. Despite significant
tensions in the region in 2013,
MECIDS participants continued
to share official health data and
information without interruption.
Together, they conducted training
on preventing the spread of
infectious disease, performed field
work on food-borne diseases and

PEACEFUL POWER WITHOUT THE RISK
NTI has worked with the IAEA on a significant initiative to prevent the
dangerous spread of uranium enrichment technology, which can be
used to create peaceful nuclear fuel but also to develop bomb-making
materials. Backed by a generous $50 million gift from Warren Buffett
and an additional $100 million from more than 30 governments, the
IAEA approved a “fuel bank” to serve as a backup in case fuel supplies
are disrupted—for nations that rely on the international market to
provide material for their nuclear power reactors. The goal: Provide
a credible option for new states to rely on the international market
for their nuclear fuel. Fuel bank implementation is under way, with a
possible site for the bank being developed in Kazakhstan.

NEW SOLUTIONS FOR THE
FUEL CYCLE
Although nuclear power can help
address global climate change, the
2011 Fukushima accident in Japan
and ongoing proliferation crises
in North Korea and Iran raise key
questions about how the world
produces fuel for nuclear power
plants. The same facilities that
make fuel—either low enriched
uranium or plutonium—for power
generation can also be used to
make fuel for nuclear weapons.
NTI and the Center for Strategic
and International Studies created
a partnership to examine safer
alternatives.
In a speech to the 2013 American
Nuclear Society annual meeting,
Sam Nunn posed the question,
“Do we really believe that we can
live securely in a system that poses
so few constraints on any state’s
ability to produce weapons-usable
nuclear materials?”
The NTI–CSIS study engaged a
spectrum of stakeholders to build
consensus on common goals
and influence policymaking on
the nuclear fuel cycle. Drawing
from top officials and experts
worldwide, the project developed
a new vision for the fuel cycle. The
approach—involving, among other
steps, greater cooperation and

A new NTI social media campaign highlights true stories about nearly catastrophic close calls
with nuclear weapons.
diversified partnerships for new
enrichment facilities and long-term
waste storage and repositories—is
designed to address the inherent
inertia and concerns about
additional burdens that have
stalled past efforts to improve
security.
As Nunn said, “We have to find
a path away from the current
paralyzing mentality of ‘haves
versus have-not’ states and
recognize that all states have to
make changes for our individual
and collective security.”
The report is scheduled to be
released in 2014.

ENCOURAGING
MORAL AND
ETHICAL PERSPECTIVES
NTI works with the faith 
community to develop 
understanding of the nuclear
threat and encourage action.
NTI supported activities that
contributed to the National
Association of Evangelicals
adopting, as part of its 
platform, the vision of a world
without nuclear weapons and
the steps to get there. In 2013,
with NTI support, the Council
of Christian Colleges and 
Universities sponsored a trip
to Hiroshima and Nagasaki, 
to explore the theological 
and moral aspects of nuclear 
weapons.
Participants called the 
trip “life changing” and 
“transformational.” Individuals
described its “significant 
impact… intellectually, 
politically, and spiritually.”
One said the trip “forced me
to reconsider how I taught 
the history of the drop-
ping of the atomic bombs.”
The participants also made
wide-ranging commitments
to bring the messages to their
peers and students.

RESOURCES EXPAND WITH NEW
TECHNOLOGIES
The more access that global
policymakers, experts, students and
academics have to credible information
on WMD threats, the greater the
possibility for informed policy
judgments. NTI’s public education
initiatives focus on ensuring open
access to data, news and analysis. In
2013, NTI supported Global Security
Newswire, offering independent, daily
news updates on nuclear, chemical
and biological threats. The NTI website
features in-depth analysis and data
developed by the James Martin Center
for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS).
New offerings take advantage of the
latest tools, such as Google maps and
3D imaging. In 2013, we also expanded
our social media presence to improve
awareness of these and other NTI
resources.

winter meeting, Sam Nunn calls on the nuclear
industry to lead on safety and security.
