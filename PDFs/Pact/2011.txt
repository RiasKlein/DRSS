note of hope
Dear friends,
I am writing to you from Namibia, where, as Permanent Secretary for the Ministry of
Gender Equality and Child Welfare, I have worked with Pact to help Namibian children
grow and thrive. When Pact recently came to my office carrying a bag that said, “Pact:
Building Local Promise,” I told them, “I can vouch for this!”
Pact has kept its promise to my ministry. Although
Namibia is among the highest-ranked countries in
the African Report on Child Wellbeing, we are also a
country where almost two in five homes care for an
orphan or foster child. So when I joined the ministry,
I faced the question: How could we better care for
children? Pact helped me set up feasible plans to achieve the country’s vision and
implement clear ways of tracking progress. This year, our ministry became one among
the first to create performance agreements for our civil servants, and the Office of the
Prime Minister called us an example for the rest of government to follow.
One of the things I appreciate about Pact is that you come to us and ask what our
priorities are. The solutions came from us, and you kept your promise to Namibia’s
public service and to our children.
“[Pact kept their]
promise to Namibia’s
public service and
to our children.”
Ms. Sirkka Ausiku, Permanent Secretary
Namibia Ministry of Local Government, Housing and Rural Development since 2012
Permanent Secretary, Namibia Ministry of Gender Equality and Child Welfare, 2004-2012
Pact is passionate about fulfilling its promises to help
people around the world exercise their voice, build local
solutions and own their own future.
In 2011, that passion resulted in practical advancements that
improved millions of lives, more than any other year in our
more than four decades of work. Here, you’ll read examples
of Pact’s passion at work and learn how we both delivered on
our promises in more than two dozen countries and helped
set free the promise that lies within those we served.
Our pursuit of local solutions includes working with
more than 11,000 local partners. At right, see how our
commitment to partnership, local solutions and results
manifests itself in promises kept.
In partnership,

Pact’s strategy supports our vision of a world where
those who are poor and marginalized discover and build
their own solutions and take ownership of their future.
Strategic goals focus on helping vulnerable people
access all they need to enjoy healthy lives, gain the
resources they need to be income-secure and gain lasting
benefit from the sustainable use of the natural resources
around them.
The hallmark of Pact’s work is
its integrated, holistic approach
to transforming lives through
strengthening local capacity,
forging effective governance
systems and transforming markets
into a force for development.
In 2011,
Pact

development
Pact engaged in capacity development before
it even had a name. For four decades, Pact
has improved the institutional capacity of
local governments, non-governmental and
civil society organizations, by helping to build
internal systems, expand networks, better
measure results of their work and participating
in community leadership. Our approach
couples rigorous grants management with
flexible solutions, empowering local groups to
respond to community needs.

A Pact platform that united civil society
organizations, activists and journalists in
Ukrainehelped to force passage of a new,
groundbreaking law: the Law on Access to
Public Information. Passed in January 2011,
the legislation obliges the Government of
Ukraine to publish information and provide
answers to citizens’ informational requests
within five days. By fostering government
transparency and granting more rights and
freedoms to citizens and organizations,
the law guarantees Ukrainians a more
democratic future.

governance
Pact’s governance programs prove citizen
participation, knowledge exchange and
advocacy are powerful tools for positive
changein institutions. We have worked with
stakeholders to shift policies on issues such
as anti-corruption and public information
and have empowered civil society
organizations to have greater influence on
legislation. By galvanizing communities
for change, we vastly improve government
services for those who are underserved.

markets
Our promise: Markets serve as a
powerful force for development.
Pact strengthens local economies by assessing and developing
markets for local products, improving production capacity and strengthening supply channels.
We transform markets to benefit local communities and encourage the safe and sustainable
extraction of natural resources. We work with communities, civil society, government institutions
and other stakeholders to safeguard natural resources, and we establish markets that ensure safe,
non-exploitative practices, particularly in the mining and forestry sectors.

In 2011, Pact implemented a groundbreaking project to
ensure a conflict-free supply chain from small mines
in Central Africa to their corporate buyers throughout
the world.The project known as iTSCi — or the ITRITin
Supply Chain Initiative — profiles artisanal mines based
on their miners, production, payments, security, history
of any human rights abuses and more. Minerals are
tagged with unique numbers so buyers can distinguish
legitimate mines from “conflict” mines.Working with the
governments of the Democratic Republic of the Congo
and Rwanda, which would both otherwise be subject
to trade embargoes, as well as with industry, donors,
local partners and civil society, Pact has implemented
the project in hundreds of mines and has helped some
45,000 artisanal miners earn a living through access to
international mineral markets.

In 2011, more than 200,000 people at high

Pact tackles health challenges locally and

organizations through grants and technical,
organizational and institutional capacity-
building that enables them to develop and
sustain quality health services, products
and information that help prevent, treat and
mitigate HIV/AIDS and other diseases. At
the same time, we engage with stakeholders
to create a policy environment supportive
of solutions to formidable public health
challenges.

livelihoods
Our promise: People with limited livelihoods gain
the resources needed to be income secure.
Pact improves access to credit for thousands of underserved
individuals in Africa and Asia, stimulating small businesses
and offering opportunity where it hadn’t before existed.
Through our livelihood programs, people become financially
literate, and the community organizations which with we
work become the institutional foundation for sustained
economic security.
That’s more than the
number of people born
every day, worldwide.
Our livelihood programs have taught
us that people are entrepreneurial
and resilient and that women-
centered, savings-led microfinance
programs can transform and activate
local economies. In Myanmar, our
microfinance programs have served
hundreds of thousands of borrowers,
with 99 percent repaying their loans on
time. Pact and its partners in Myanmar
have helped 2.5 million people over the
past 14 years build better incomes and
improve their access to quality health
care, education and improved nutrition.

Pact is a promise of a better tomorrow for all those who are poor and
marginalized. In FY2011, we began work on expressing that promise in a more
powerful and memorable way.
What emerged was a visualization of that promise through an organic mosaic
whose composition of interconnected pieces creates a greater whole. It evokes
the cascading impact of Pact’s work: Global change through local solutions.
Pact is not just our name. It’s a powerful symbol for who we are.
Pact is a promise.
