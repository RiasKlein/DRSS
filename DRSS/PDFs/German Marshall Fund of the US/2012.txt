Annual Report 2012
40th Anniversary u 1972 - 2012
The German Marshall Fund of the United States (GMF) strengthens transatlantic cooperation
on regional, national, and global challenges and opportunities in the spirit of the Marshall
Plan.
GMF does this by supporting individuals and institutions working in the transatlantic sphere,
by convening leaders and members of the policy and business communities, by contributing
research and analysis on transatlantic topics, and by providing exchange opportunities to
foster renewed commitment to the transatlantic relationship.
In addition, GMF supports a number of initiatives to strengthen democracies. Founded in
1972 as a non-partisan, non-profit organization through a gift from Germany as a permanent
memorial to Marshall Plan assistance, GMF maintains a strong presence on both sides of
the Atlantic. In addition to its headquarters in Washington, DC, GMF has offices in Berlin,
Paris, Brussels, Belgrade, Ankara, Bucharest, Warsaw, and Tunis. GMF also has smaller
representations in Bratislava, Turin, and Stockholm.

Letter from the President
I
n 1972, the year GMF was
created, the Soviet Union was
a global force matched only
by the United States, and China
was just starting to open itself up to
capitalism and the West. Democracy
was largely limited to North America
and Europe, but those countries were
beginning to feel the influence that
energy-rich Middle East countries
could exert on our economies and
our security.
Over the past 40 years, GMF has
adjusted to the significant develop-
ments in global politics. Whether
it was opening up to Central and
Eastern Europe soon after the
Berlin Wall fell, identifying Turkey
as an important regional power,
or addressing the rise of Asia with
programming on China, India, and
Japan, we have stuck to our core
mission of promoting transatlantic
cooperation based on the assumption
that the United States and Europe will
continue to be the closest of allies.
As I look ahead, I see four major
developments that will affect the
international community.
First, new discoveries in North and
South America and Africa and new
technologies are changing the supply
and demand for energy on a global
scale. This revolution in energy
should reduce prices and, equally
important, reduce the power and
importance of traditional suppliers
in the Middle East and Russia. GMF
has developed programming that
looks at how new supplies of gas and
the development of renewables is
fostering a shift away from coal, that
examines the regional impacts of gas
and oil discoveries in the Eastern
Mediterranean and Central Europe,
and that researches the economic and
political consequences of new oil and
gas discoveries in the Atlantic Basin.
Second, global power is becoming
increasingly decentralized as coun-
tries in Asia, Africa, and Latin
America have emerged as new
economic and political players. These
new actors have different aspira-
tions and capacities, but they have
a common interest in reworking
international institutions so that
power and influence more accurately
reflects their role in the world. GMF
has been following this develop-
ment closely. Six years ago,
we established the Stockholm
Forum on China, and this semi-
annual meeting continues to be
an important meeting place for
Americans and Europeans focused
on this important Asian power.
We have created similar forums
on India and Turkey. We are also
co-leading the Global Swing States
project to examine how Brazil, India,
Indonesia, and Turkey shape global
politics and international institu-
tions.
Third, immigration is shifting from
problem to opportunity. Aging and
declining populations have set off an
international competition for skilled
workers. At the same time, many
developing countries are focused on
convincing talented émigrés living
in Europe, the United States, and
Middle East to bring their skills
and capital home and contribute
to economic growth in their native
lands. GMF has had an active immi-
gration program for years. Now, with
a partner institution in Europe, we
will undertake a closer look at this
2 | 2012 Annual Report
emerging competition for talent and
the instruments that are being used
to attract and retain human capital.
This will complement our existing
projects on immigration, integration,
and global development.
Fourth, city and regional govern-
ments have become engines of devel-
opment. Amid a national downturn
in the Spanish economy, for example,
Bilbao and the Basque region are
thriving and attracting new inves-
tors and new visitors to this revived
metropolitan area. GMF has grown
our Urban and Regional Policy
program in order to share the best
strategies and practices used in cities
and metropolitan areas in Europe
and the United States. Our Marshall
Memorial Fellowship program is
also part of this effort since many of
the young political and civic leaders
who participate in this program are
focused on making their home cities
and regions better able to compete in
a globalized world.
There are also three long-standing
issues that continue to be central to
our work.
First, from North Africa to Asia,
there are zones of conflict and
turmoil that challenge U.S. and
European policymakers to think
more rigorously and creatively about
how to respond. GMF has initiated
a new Transatlantic Security Task
Force focused on these challenges.
We are also doing more research on
the implications of drone warfare,
cyber terrorism, and other security
developments.
Second, the financial and economic
troubles of Europe and the United
States continue to be a major
concern. Reductions in spending
on hard and soft power as a result
of tightened budgets have compli-
cated the ability of the transatlantic
community to respond to global
problems such as turmoil in the
Sahel, human rights abuses in Syria,
and nuclear threats in Iran. Maybe
more importantly, the transatlantic
economic and political model has
lost some of its standing in the inter-
national community. Last year, GMF
initiated the EuroFuture Project,
which is examining Europe’s choices
as it confronts its financial and gover-
nance difficulties.
Third, governance has become a
pressing problem in democracies.
Citizens have become disillusioned
with political processes due to
corruption, ineffectiveness, and
unresponsiveness by public officials.
GMF’s regional trusts concentrate
most of their resources on building
civil society and the capacity of
citizens to monitor public officials
and hold them accountable. Our
newest trust, the MENA Partnership
for Democracy and Development,
will support NGOs in North Africa
and, eventually, the entire Middle
East. We recognize that our modest
resources will not be sufficient alone
to create strong and vibrant civil
societies. But we do believe that our
funding of model organizations helps
to set a high standard for the growth
of civil society.
For 40 years, GMF has concentrated
on the opportunities and chal-
lenges that define the transatlantic
relationship. We have tried to keep
our eye on the core issues while still
remaining flexible and open to new
developments. The following annual
report shows the efforts we have
made toward those ends over the last
year, and it is a guide to the breadth
and depth of research, publishing,
and programming we will continue
to pursue in the coming years.

January
Congress Bundestag Forum
The Ninth Annual Congress-Bund-
estag Forum, a partnership with the
Robert Bosch Stiftung, took place
January 28-31 in Delray Beach,
Florida, and Washington, DC. Eight
members of the German Bundestag,
including Gisela Piltz (left), and four
members of the U.S. House of Repre-
sentatives, including Alcee Hastings
(right), participated in roundtable
discussions in Florida that focused
on economic growth, power shifts
in international politics, and cyber
security. The German participants
then traveled to Washington and met
with officials at the U.S. Department
of State and the Pentagon.
The Danish EU Presidency
In a discussion on January 24 at
GMF’s Washington headquarters,
João Vale de Almeida, European
Union ambassador to the United
States, and Danish Ambassador to
the United States Peter Taksoe-Jensen
spoke about Denmark’s commitment
to achieving a “responsible, dynamic,
green, and safe Europe” during its
EU Presidency. Noting the contrast
to Denmark’s narrow focus during its
2002 EU Presidency, Taksoe-Jensen
explained that the EU is facing a
range of critical issues that are among
the greatest in the history of the
European Union.
EuroFuture Project
Policy Briefs
On January 19, GMF’s EuroFu-
ture Project, which explores the
economic, governance, and geostra-
tegic dimensions of the euro crisis
from a transatlantic perspective,
published the first of 16 policy briefs,
“The Limits of German Power” by
Thomas Kleine-Brockhoff and Hanns
W. Maull. The project addresses the
impact, implications, and ripple
effects of the crisis through a combi-
nation of initiatives on both sides of
the Atlantic.

February
Iran and the West: How
Does it End?
On February 2, the GMF Brussels
office hosted Ambassador Dennis
Ross (left) to discuss Iran’s nuclear
ambitions based on his recent
experience leading Iran policy in
the Obama Administration. The
event was moderated by Sir Michael
Leigh (right), GMF senior advisor.
According to Ross, the Iranian
regime has begun to lose its leverage
in the region and has never found
itself so isolated before.
Task Force Encourages
New Approach to U.S.–EU
Trade Relations
In mid-February, GMF launched a
report from the Transatlantic Task
Force on Trade and Investment, “A
New Era for Transatlantic Trade
Leadership” with events in Paris,
Brussels, Berlin, and Washington.
Task Force ideas and recommenda-
tions encouraged new thinking about
this relationship, possibly in the form
of a “free trade zone” that transcends
customary free trade agreement
conventions. The Transatlantic Task
Force on Trade and Investment is
a joint initiative by GMF and the
European Center for International
Political Economy.
Balkan Peer Exchange
From February 21-23, the first
Balkan Peer Exchange provided
a space for 100 representatives of
think tanks and advocacy organiza-
tions with established track records
in policy-relevant research to share
best practices and to brainstorm
about innovative approaches to
common challenges. The regional
event, co-organized and supported
by the Balkan Trust for Democracy,
enhanced analysis and research-
based advocacy in an era of open
data through facilitating exchanges
between a representative group of
think tanks, advocacy organizations,
and donors active in the Western
Balkan region.

Brussels Forum
From March 23-25, GMF held
the seventh Brussels Forum, an
annual high-level meeting of North
American and European political,
corporate, and intellectual leaders
to address the pressing challenges
facing the United States and Europe.
Notable speakers included Anders
Fogh Rasmussen, NATO secretary
general; Carl Bildt, Swedish minister
for foreign affairs; and the members
of a congressional delegation led
by U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen. The
conference addressed topics ranging
from the euro crisis to Iran, from
food security to energy security.
I just wanted to congrat-
ulate you on the excel-
lent quality of the
discussions and the high
level of the programme.
This was an unforget-
table experience.

YTN Celebrates Fifth
Anniversary
On March 8, GMF celebrated the
fifth anniversary of the Young
Transatlantic Network (YTN) with a
reception in Brussels, in cooperation
with the U.S. Mission to the EU. YTN
was created five years ago with the
support of the U.S. Mission to the EU
as a platform for young professionals
in the world of politics, business,
and policy and has been expanded
to Berlin and Warsaw. In a keynote
address, William E. Kennard, the U.S.
ambassador to the EU, expressed a
high level of optimism for the trans-
atlantic relationship.
On Turkey Series
On March 30, GMF’s Ankara office
published two more installments of
its On Turkey policy briefs series,
one by Ilter Turan discussing French
and Turkish relations and the other
by Joshua Walker on sectarianism in
the Turkish government. On Turkey
is an ongoing series of analysis briefs
about Turkey’s current political situ-
ation and its future. GMF provides
regular analysis briefs by leading
Turkish, European, and U.S. writers,
with a focus on dispatches from
on-the-ground Turkish observers.
A total of 38 of these briefs were
published in 2012.

Global Europe: Game Over?
On April 13, GMF’s Washington
office hosted a conversation with
Toomas Hendrik Ilves, president of
the Republic of Estonia. The event,
“Global Europe: Game Over?,” was
centered around the current and
future state of affairs in Europe,
future prospects for the European
Union as a whole, and the increas-
ingly diverse relations between the
EU states, both internally and exter-
nally. Ilves placed a major emphasis
on the need for the EU to address
the growing divide between Eastern
and Western states within the union,
adding that German leadership
would be decisive going forward on
this issue. Later in the year, on July 3,
Ilves spoke at GMF’s Berlin office on
“Austerity vs. Growth.”
Marshall Forum
From April 26-29, the 2012 Marshall
Forum gathered more than 100
Marshall Memorial Fellowship
alumni in Dallas, Texas, for a
weekend of discussions focused on
“The New Economy: A New Reality.”
Five keynote discussions included
Allison Cerra, director of marketing
at Alcatel Lucent, and former
U.S. Ambassador to Saudi Arabia
Robert Jordan. There were also eight
in-depth panel discussions including
conversations on energy, defense
policy, and social media; and 10 tours
across Dallas, from museums and
stadiums to historic sites and areas of
economic revitalization.
Conversation with
Baroness Catherine Ashton
On April 10, Baroness Catherine
Ashton, high representative of the
European Union for foreign affairs
and security policy, spoke at GMF
Washington on a range of topics
including the Arab Spring, the
intersection between economics and
foreign policy, women in conflicts,
and Ashton’s own understanding
of the concept of “deep democ-
racy,” which she said must be estab-
lished in the Arab Spring countries.

May
Energy Transition Forum
On May 13-15, GMF convened the
first meeting of the Energy Transi-
tion Forum (ETF). The ETF brings
together a select group of high-level
policymakers and business leaders
in an annual dialogue on the transi-
tion to a more secure, affordable,
and low-carbon energy system in
the United States and Europe. The
ETF works to produce new thinking
around the key challenges facing the
energy system, including more inte-
grated thinking in systems design,
grid optimization and security, and
promoting innovation.
Preview of the Chicago
NATO Summit
On May 3, GMF’s Berlin office hosted
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State
Philip Gordon for a breakfast discus-
sion entitled “Transatlantic Security
in a Changing World: A Countdown
to the Chicago NATO Summit.”
Gordon reaffirmed the United States’
choice of Europe as its “partner of
first resort” corresponding to a need
for strong partners that share its
values and interests. He also spoke of
a “deliberate and conscious effort” to
strengthen the transatlantic partner-
ship.
Inaugural Asmus Fellows
and Seminar
On May 24-25, GMF held the first
Ron Asmus Policy Entrepreneur
seminar at Schloss Elmau, an hour
southwest of Munich. The gathering
included a number of European and
U.S. political, policy, and academic
figures who played a role in the
life of Ron Asmus, GMF’s former
Brussels office executive director,
who died in 2011. At the off-the-
record seminar, the inaugural Ron
Asmus Policy Entrepreneur Fellows
— Nora Fisher Onar, Merle Maigre,
and Mark Simakovsky — presented
their topic proposals for consider-
ation, conversation, and critique by
the gathered experts, who included
Estonian President Toomas Ilves,
Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt,
and Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars
Rinkevics.

were designed to create an altogether
new organization. This organization
became GMF.
In a June 5, 1972, speech at Harvard,
West German Chancellor Willy
Brandt announced that his govern-
ment would give 150 million marks
[$47 million] to establish GMF as a
permanent memorial to the Marshall
Plan assistance the United States
delivered to Western Europe. 
This and many other tales of GMF
were told at the anniversary gala, an
event that also marked Goldman’s
retirement from the GMF Board.
“GMF would not exist if it were not
for the efforts of Guido Goldman,”
said GMF President Craig Kennedy.
“He has been a steadfast guardian of
the organization from inception until
today.” In a decision the day before,
O
n May 22, GMF marked its
40th
anniversary with a gala
in Berlin for more than 130
members of the political, diplomatic,
academic, think tank, business, and
media communities of Berlin. 
The idea for GMF was launched in
early 1970 when Guido Goldman,
then the executive director of West
European studies at Harvard Univer-
sity, asked the West German govern-
ment to consider a gift to Harvard
on the upcoming 25th
anniversary of
the announcement of the Marshall
Plan. In response, Alex Möller, West
German minister for finance, indi-
cated that the West German govern-
ment would most likely act only if
the gift were significantly larger than
$50,000 originally requested and
May – 40th
Anniversary
J. Robinson West was elected
co-chair of the GMF Board of
Trustees, replacing Goldman, who
was named founder and chairman
emeritus.
West and fellow co-chair Marc
Leland will continue Goldman’s
vision of an organization that works
to build bridges between North
America and Europe, bringing
together thousands of the top poli-
cymakers and thinkers to focus on
their common issues and challenges,
including everything from arms
control to economic policy to waste
disposal, which was addressed in one
of GMF’s first grants.
And through new programs such
as the Wider Atlantic and Asia
programs and the MENA Partner-
ship for Democracy & Development,
GMF is helping Europe and the
United States share their experiences
with — and learn from — the rest of
the world.

The Global Resource Nexus
On June 1, the GMF Brussels office
and the German Institute for Inter-
national and Security Affairs hosted a
roundtable workshop on the transat-
lantic governance of resource risks.
This event also served as the Euro-
pean launch of a major new report
by the Transatlantic Academy, The
Global Resource Nexus – The Struggles
for Land, Energy, Food, Water and
Minerals. This report reveals that
severe market disruptions and violent
conflict at the interstate and local
level in many global hotspots are
increasingly likely unless the trans-
atlantic community takes the lead in
addressing the challenges of unprec-
edented global demand for resources.
Muslim Communities
Outreach: A Conversation
with Farah Pandith
GMF Brussels hosted a lunchtime
discussion with Farah Pandith, U.S.
Special Representative to Muslim
Communities, on June 19. Pandith
provided a frank overview of the U.S.
administration’s motivation behind
creating her position at the Depart-
ment of State, and what its vision for
“engagement” with Muslims around
the globe means. She explained why
her work focuses on people under the
age of 30 and how she utilizes social
media to achieve her goals. She also
outlined the particular challenges
that our increasingly connected and
digitalized communities can pose. 
BTD Awards 1,000th
Grant
The Balkan Trust for Democracy
(BTD) awarded its 1,000th
grant
in June with a $24,900 grant to
Internews Kosova. BTD is a 10-year,
$36-million grantmaking initia-
tive that supports democracy,
good governance, and Euroatlantic
integration in Southeastern Europe.
Internews Kosova, a media devel-
opment organization, will use the
grant to finance its operations in
monitoring the performance of the
police and judicial bodies in Kosovo.
The grant will also aid the non-profit
organization in researching and
televising regular debates and reports
on the effectiveness of police and
judicial institutions based on those
monitoring efforts.

Romney: The United States
and Poland Face the Future
“with Solidarity”
In a public address co-organized by
the Polish Institute of International
Affairs, GMF’s Warsaw office, and the
Lech Walesa Institute on July 31, Mitt
Romney, the Republican nominee
for U.S. president, said the values
of peace and liberty have marked
the strong relationship between the
United States and Poland. “I, and
my fellow Americans, are inspired
by the path of freedom tread by the
people of Poland,” Romney said to an
audience of more than 700 people,
including dignitaries, members of
the public, and press gathered at the
University of Warsaw Library.
The International Forum
on Border Security
On July 10-11, GMF Bucharest
hosted the second International
Forum on Border Security in part-
nership with the presidential admin-
istration of the Republic of Romania.
The forum brought together 40
senior policymakers and experts
from Europe, the United States,
and Israel to discuss the unprece-
dented political and operational chal-
lenges in the area of border security
and to build consensus on solutions
to internal and external border
challenges, including terrorism,
transnational organized crime,
illegal immigration, and threats to
commerce.
Implications of Gas
Discoveries in the Eastern
Mediterranean
GMF published a series of eight
policy briefs discussing the geopo-
litical implications of significant
natural gas discoveries in the Eastern
Mediterranean. On July 11, Sir
Michael Leigh (left), GMF senior
advisor; Toula Onoufriou (right),
Vice Rector for Academic Affairs
of the Cyprus University of Tech-
nology; and other experts took these
publications to a briefing at the U.S.
Capitol and explained to members
of Congress and their staff how this
issue is sure to impact the region.

Transatlantic Forum on
Migration and Integration
The fifth Transatlantic Forum on
Migration and Integration (TFMI)
meeting, titled “Learning from
Canada and Recapturing Five Years
of TFMI: Best Practices in Immigra-
tion and Integration Management,”
took place from August 8-12 in
Toronto, Canada. Topics discussed
included integration, citizenship,
multiculturalism, and national iden-
tity, with site visits in the Toronto
area. Established in 2008 in partner-
ship with the Robert Bosch Stiftung,
TFMI brings together young leaders
from business, government, media,
academia, and the nonprofit sector
from around the world to discuss
the challenges and opportunities
presented by ongoing migration. 
On Wider Europe
Policy Briefs
GMF released four On Wider Europe
briefs in August, covering topics
ranging from proposed trade corri-
dors between Eastern Europe and
Central Asia to the rise of radical
Islam in Russia’s Volga Ural region.
The On Wider Europe series focuses
on key intellectual and policy debates
regarding Western policy toward
Wider Europe that otherwise might
receive insufficient attention. The
series included 19 different policy
briefs in 2012, covering Russia,
Ukraine, and Central Asian nations.
Marshall Memorial Fellows
During 2012, 50 U.S. and 54 Euro-
pean young leaders participated in
the Marshall Memorial Fellowship.
Travelling to five cities in groups
of 15-20 participants for 24 days in
spring, summer, and fall cohorts,
Fellows were given the opportunity
to explore each other’s politics, busi-
nesses, innovations, and cultures.
Upon their return, Fellows on both
sides of the Atlantic have devel-
oped ideas inspired by their travels,
from international dinner circles in
California and a Native-American
community store in Colorado to a

Belgrade Security Forum
2012
The Balkan Trust for Democracy
was a partner in the second Belgrade
Security Forum, “Coping with the
Crisis: Challenges to Democracy
and Security,” held September 20-22.
The forum brought together leading
strategic thinkers and policymakers
to discuss new and long-standing
security issues including human
security, new energy partnerships,
the crisis of economy and democracy
in Europe, the new role of China,
models of regional cooperation on
foreign and security policy, cyber-
crime as a governance challenge,
migration, and women’s approaches

India Trilateral Forum
On September 14-15, GMF and
the Aspen Institute India co-hosted
the fifth India Trilateral Forum in
Gurgaon, outside New Delhi. The
two-day dialogue involved over
50 participants including govern-
ment officials from India, the
United States, Sweden, France, and
Germany; scholars from over a
dozen universities and think tanks;
multinational business representa-
tives from the banking, automotive,
pharmaceutical, and IT sectors; and
commentators from leading Indian
and Western publications. Topics
covered included domestic political
developments in the United States,
Europe, and India; Indian economic
reforms and the implications of
the global financial crisis; develop-
ments in China, Afghanistan, and
Myanmar; and maintaining access to
space and cyberspace.
Transatlantic Trends
The 11th
annual Transatlantic Trends
survey revealed that transatlantic
majorities still approve of U.S. Presi-
dent Barack Obama’s foreign policy,
and that Mitt Romney was largely
an unknown in Europe. The survey,
released on September 12 in conjunc-
tion with the Compagnia di San
Paolo and several other partners, also
showed that despite the economic
crisis, 61 percent of Europeans still
considered membership in the EU to
be a good thing for their economies.

space, with southern Atlantic
partners such as Brazil and Southern
and West Africa playing a larger
role, GMF extended its convening,
networking, and research to
Morocco, Brazil, South Africa, and
other emerging actors around the
Atlantic Basin through a major new
conference, The Atlantic Dialogues.
From September 28-30, GMF
partnered with the OCP Founda-
tion of Morocco to host the Atlantic
Dialogues, a high-level gathering of
international public- and private-
sector leaders from around the
Atlantic Basin. Following the highly
September – Atlantic Dialogues
successful Brussels Forum model,
more than 250 participants from
Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Europe,
and North and South America gath-
ered in Rabat, Morocco, to discuss
cross-regional issues. Participants
came from the governmental, busi-
ness, think tank, and media sectors,
and from 42 countries. Planned as an
annual event, the Atlantic Dialogues
encourages a lively and informal
exchange of views.
The Atlantic Dialogues agenda
examined transatlantic relations from
a new perspective, encompassing the
voices of Southern Atlantic leaders
on cross-regional issues affecting
the Atlantic Basin. Topics covered
included maritime security, urban-
ization, opportunities for youth,
Asian players in the region, global
trade, migration, and terrorism.

October
Ukraine Study Tour
GMF, in partnership with the Center
for Independent Journalism in
Romania, brought a delegation of
four European journalists to Ukraine
from October 26-30 for a study tour
focused on Ukraine’s current prob-
lems and progress and the October
28 parliamentary elections. On
election day, the delegation trav-
eled 40 kilometers outside Kiev to
observe the elections before visiting
the campaign headquarters of the
opposition UDAR party, where Vitali
Klitschko, the party’s leader, held
a press conference on the exit poll
results and his party’s plans for the
post-electoral period.
Screening of The Second
Meeting
On October 15, GMF and the
Embassy of the Republic of Serbia
co-hosted the Washington premiere
of The Second Meeting, a Serbian film
about the reconciliation between U.S.
pilot Dale Zelko and Serbian missile
officer Zoltan Dani. Zelko and Dani
first encountered one another when
Dani shot down Zelko’s F117A
stealth aircraft in March 1999, during
the Balkan conflict. Twelve years
later, they reunited as friends. The
Second Meeting traces the emotional
journey of two people separated
culturally, socially, and geographi-
cally, brought together by a random
act of war. It was produced in part
with funding from GMF’s Balkan

The 2012 Transatlantic Cities
Network (TCN) annual meeting took
place in Birmingham, U.K., from
September 30-October 3. TCN is
an ongoing project that provides a
framework for sustained exchange
of information about innovative
urban policies. In total, 16 delegates
from the United States and Europe
attended the meeting and toured
several active construction sites, a
science park, and neighborhood
planning areas outside the city center.
Topics covered during the meetings
included the localization and decen-
tralization agenda in the U.K., public
investment and city center revitaliza-
tion, neighborhood planning, and
social impact bonds.

November
Global Swing States
Policy Papers Release
GMF and the Center for a New
American Security jointly launched
a new report, Global Swing States:
Brazil, India, Indonesia, Turkey and
the Future of International Order. Five
smaller papers in the same series
explored human rights, non-prolif-
eration, finance, trade, and maritime
issues. Held on November 27, the
launch event featured remarks from
U.S. Under Secretary of State Robert
D. Hormats on the importance of
“global swing states” and why this
concept offers a new framework for
thinking about these four powers.
U.S. Elections Events
GMF’s Paris office held an inter-
national symposium entitled “U.S.
Presidential Elections 2012,” which
was an opportunity for participants
to explore the issues that influenced
the campaign and that had a bearing
on the November 6 vote. Former U.S.
senator and current GMF trustee
Robert Bennett was one of several
speakers. GMF offices in Berlin,
Brussels, and Warsaw also held
election-related events before and
after U.S. voters went to the polls.
Wider Atlantic Books
GMF’s Wider Atlantic Program has
produced major works of research
on issues affecting the Atlantic Basin
from north to south. In November,
three books were published on
energy, maritime policy challenges,
and new actors in the Atlantic,
joining earlier works on Morocco’s
new geopolitics and food security
from an Atlantic perspective.
looks forward to joining
@xeniadormandy here in
Berlin for a @gmfus

dential elections

Mediterranean
Policy Papers
GMF has made a multi-year stra-
tegic grant to the Italian Institute
for International Affairs to support
the work of the Mediterranean
Policy Program, and to promote
transatlantic research and publication
on Mediterranean issues. Three of
the resulting papers were published
in December: “Southern Europe
in Trouble: Domestic and Foreign
Policy Challenges of the Financial
Crisis,” “A Transatlantic Perspec-
tive on the European Union and the
United States in North Africa,” and
“The GCC in the Mediterranean in
Light of the Arab Spring.”
MENA Partnership
for Democracy and
Development
On December 13, U.S. Deputy
Secretary of State William Burns
announced the creation of the
MENA Partnership for Democracy
& Development, based in Tunis,
Tunisia. This partnership between
the U.S. Department of State, GMF,
and other funders will function as an
international clearinghouse of service
providers, donors, experts, and prac-
titioners that civil society organiza-
tions and government institutions
can draw upon to meet their specific
needs in the newly democratic envi-
ronment of the transformed Arab
world. The MENA Partnership will
have a particular focus on women’s
empowerment, democratic advocacy,
and economic reform.
Stockholm China Forum
The 11th
Stockholm China Forum
was held for the first time in China,
in Beijing, on December 7-8 in part-
nership with the Swedish Ministry
for Foreign Affairs and the China
Institute of International Studies.
The forum included discussions on
strategic stability in the Asia-Pacific;
the political and foreign policy impli-
cations of China’s leadership transi-
tion; European, U.S., and Chinese
economic outlooks; and the future
of U.S.-Europe-China cooperation.
Featured speakers included Fu Ying,
Chinese vice minister of foreign
affairs, and Carl Bildt, Swedish
minister for foreign affairs.

35 countries have completed the
program. The Goldman Director-
ship will commemorate his service
to GMF and cement the financial
security of this critical initiative.
