Leadership Message
Brookings
Strobe Talbott
President
John L. Thornton
Chair of the Board
hen Robert S. Brookings and a group of like-minded reformers established the Brookings
Institution nearly a century ago, they were guided by the simple but profound belief
that good governance results from good ideas and that good ideas are based on respect
for facts, rigorous thinking, rational debate, and civil discourse. It is a testament to our
founder that his vision has guided us across the decades and continents, into the era
of globalization and the digital age.
Brookings brings an unparalleled breadth and depth of expertise to the most pressing challenges to
­
governance, with experts working across disciplines to develop comprehensive solutions. As we near the
end of our first century of doing this important work, we remain true to the trinity of values that has been
at the heart of what we do since Brookings was founded: Quality, Independence, and Impact.
Quality. We’re proud to be found on the Internet at brookings.edu. It’s a subtle but deeply important
symbol of our commitment to upholding the standards of intellectual rigor maintained by the world’s most
respected educational institutions. Our institutional reputation for excellence derives from the individual
excellence of our 270 resident and nonresident scholars, who collaborate across fields of expertise—and in
many cases across the globe—to generate fresh, bold ideas.
Independence. By any measure, our government is more polarized than it was a generation ago,
with intense and destructive partisanship in Washington and many state capitals. In this environment,
Brookings’s independence is our greatest asset. It means that policymakers across the ideological spectrum
take our ideas seriously and value our analysis. It enables us to convene people with diverse views for
­
reasoned, honest debate.
Impact. At Brookings, we strive to make sure that the product of our thinking influences the thinking
and action of people who can make our recommendations a reality. Often, our own scholars and Trustees
pass through the revolving door between Brookings and the U.S. government. In recent years, as we’ve
globalized Brookings, our talent pool has benefited other governments and international institutions. While
never faltering in our commitment to high-quality research, we’re investing in dissemination through both
traditional and emerging channels.
For nearly a century, we’ve stayed true to our original purpose of improving the way that communi-
ties—from the local to the national to the global—govern themselves. We also recognize that our ability
to achieve real impact stems from how we govern the Institution, including fostering an atmosphere of
intellectual freedom for our scholars. We have been entrusted with upholding Mr. Brookings’s legacy and
we owe it to our predecessors—and our successors—along with our Trustees and generous supporters, to
manage our human, financial, and physical resources.
Perhaps Mr. Brookings would not recognize many aspects of the world we live in today, with our nearly
instantaneous exchanges of information over cyberspace and the fragmented
nature of domestic and international politics. Yet we have no doubt he
would be proud of this Institution and our continued commitment to his
vision of providing good ideas to improve governance.

rookings research spans topics ranging from the global economy to national security crises to
­
metropolitan-level strategies for growth to the health of national and international political institutions.
Each of Brookings’s five research programs has unique capabilities in its particular focus area. Those
programs—Economic Studies, Foreign Policy, Global Economy and Development, Governance Stud-
ies, and Metropolitan Policy—may, at first glance, seem to be disconnected from each other; but rather
than being five separate think tanks under one roof, Brookings is one Institution tied together by an
overarching theme: governance.
Governance Studies was Brookings’s original research program, committed to figuring out how we can best
organize, regulate, protect, and expand our communities. In an ever-more-interconnected world—characterized
by economic globalization but increasingly knitted together on a personal level through social media—our concep-
tion of the community has expanded from the local and national to encompass a global vision of shared risks and
shared opportunities.
Governance—whether in the public sector or private sector—involves mitigating risks and taking­advantage
of opportunities. That, in turn, requires well-functioning institutions that have the capacity to engage informed
citizens and chart a course for the well-being of humanity. Political dysfunction in ­
Washington is imposing sig-
nificant—and unnecessary—costs on America’s economy and national security, raising serious questions about
whether the United States can continue to play a leadership role in advancing peace and prosperity.
Threats that spill across borders need a response from a truly international community. Some of the world’s
most pressing security challenges are themselves the result of failed governance. Generations that follow will bear
the consequences of the action—or inaction—we take now.
In short, governance matters, and Brookings scholars are dedicated to promoting good governance and the
informed citizenry that supports it.

Economic Studies
T
Opportunities for a New Era
he U.S. economy has been resilient
since the Great Recession, yet strong
growth remains elusive. Many families
are still challenged by job loss, inad-
equate savings, lack of access to credit,
and high health care and education
costs. The Economic Studies program is focused on
revitalizing U.S. economic conditions and achiev-
ing broadly shared economic growth for decades to
come. Meeting these goals will require innovative
economic policies driven by informed discourse,
drawing in a range of expert viewpoints that are
firmly rooted in rigorous analysis.
Devising Sensible Long-Term Deficit
Reduction Proposals
Too often in Washington, political posturing and
ideological rigidity are substituted for serious,
workable approaches to solving our nation’s fiscal
challenges. In an effort to advance more concrete
ideas, the Hamilton Project at Brookings invited
recognized economic experts from around the
country—and across the political spectrum—to
make concrete proposals. The resulting publica-
tion, 15 Ways to Rethink the Federal Budget, pro-
vided President Obama and Congress with innova-
tive, actionable policy ideas on how to reduce the
deficit and create a growing economy that benefits
more Americans.
For example, Adele Morris, Economic Stud-
ies Fellow and Policy Director of the Climate and
Energy Economics Project, outlined a carbon tax
plan to reduce the deficit by $199 billion over 10
years while also achieving climate change goals.
Another innovative solution came from Vice Presi-
dent and Co-Director of Economic Studies Karen
Dynan, the Robert S. Kerr Senior Fellow, who
proposed tax policy changes that would promote
increased savings among Americans, while reduc-
ing the budget deficit by $40 billion over 10 years.
These policy recommendations, and the 13 others
from the Hamilton Project, attracted attention from
the White House and Capitol Hill.
Leading the Conversation on Tax Policy
Tax reform remains a central part of any sensible
path toward long-term fiscal health. The Tax
Policy Center, a joint project of Brookings and
the Urban Institute, is playing a pivotal role in
the debate by providing independent evaluations
of new policy ideas. Praised for its careful, non-
partisan­approach and the sophistication of its
modeling capabilities, the Tax Policy Center is well
established as the go-to place for estimates of the
“People
who observe
Brookings have
respected the
intellectual
integrity, the
thoughtful
analysis, and
the honest
debate that

sation about how to
provide better care
at lower cost. The
reforms proposed
in the report, which

and possibly $1 tril-
lion in 20, if imple-
mented soon. Former

Economic Studies
Financial Reform at
Home and Abroad
D
uring the recent financial crisis, exist-
ing U.S. financial regulations were
shown to be inadequate and even
dangerous to our economy. How to
improve them—and whether the Dodd-Frank
reforms achieve the balance needed to foster a
healthy financial system—is the subject of intense
debate on Wall Street and Main Street and in
Washington. Brookings experts are undertaking
thoughtful examination of the effects and effec-
tiveness of competing proposals.
Senior Fellow Martin Baily has played a lead-
ing role in shaping this debate as co-chair of the
Bipartisan Policy Center’s Financial Regulatory
Reform Initiative. Baily and his colleagues are
looking at complicated but essential issues such
as how to deal with non-bank financial institu-
tions, “too big to fail” banks, and regulating
derivatives.
Brookings experts are also playing a criti-
cal role in regulatory discussions abroad. Senior
Fellow and former Vice Chairman of the Federal
Reserve Donald Kohn is advising the United King-
dom’s Financial Policy Committee on financial
reforms, in addition to his work on the advisory
committee of the new Office of Financial Research
at the U.S. Department of the Treasury.
Economic Studies Council
B
rookings established the Economic
Studies Council to create opportunities
to engage leaders from the front lines
of the U.S. economy with Brookings
experts. Under the leadership of Chairman Wilbur
Ross, Brookings Trustee and Chairman and CEO
of WL Ross and Co., and Vice Chairman H. Rodgin
Cohen, Senior Chairman of Sullivan & Cromwell,
the Council has grown in the three years since its
creation. The members of the Economic Studies
Council provide important financial support to
the Economic Studies program, along with critical
perspectives on the effects of economic policies
on the business community. Through a series of
roundtable discussions, regular conference calls,
and expert briefings, members of the Council
take part in substantive dialogue with Brookings
scholars around the most pressing topics on the
nation’s economic agenda.

impact and distribution of tax reform proposals.
During the 2012 presidential election, a paper
by Tax Policy Center Co-Director and Economic
Studies Senior Fellow William Gale, the Arjay and
Frances Fearing Miller Chair in Federal Economic
Policy, and Hamilton Project Policy Director and
Economic Studies Senior Fellow Adam Looney,
along with Research Associate Sam Brown, looked
at Governor Romney’s proposed tax plan, examin-
ing tradeoffs among revenues, progressivity, and
rates in tax reform. The report was cited more
than 13,000 times in the media and drove the
public conversation during the campaign—includ-
ing in presidential and vice presidential debates—
over the shape and contours of tax policy. The
paper is a clear demonstration of how Brookings’s
commitment to careful and thoughtful analysis
makes the Institution an essential player in how
policymakers and the public think about the solu-
tions to our most important challenges.
Creating Long-Term Opportunity
and Economic Growth
Efforts to address economic growth with too near-
term a view can give short shrift to important invest-
ments in growth. Brookings experts are focusing crit-
ical attention on the steps needed to foster long-term
and broadly shared economic growth and increase
opportunity for individuals at all income levels.
With an eye toward how best to build human
capital, Co-Director of the Center on Children and
Families Isabel Sawhill, holder of the Cabot Family­
“There’s no
think tank
report or
academic
study in recent
memory that’s

way the Tax

analysis of
Mitt Romney’s
tax plan has
dominated this
one.”

contrast to prevailing views, lays out how both inno-
vation and technological opportunities and the com-
ing energy revolution can lead to future growth.

Foreign Policy

Meeting Challenges to the Global Order
oday, complex threats to U.S. and
global security—from organized crime
and terrorism to nuclear proliferation
and climate change—demand policy
approaches that go beyond traditional
concepts of diplomacy and defense.
New challenges continue to emerge in surprising
ways and in multiple domains, from cyberspace
and the South China Sea to the streets of Cairo
and São Paulo. These crises and transitions exist
against a backdrop of changing U.S. foreign
policy priorities: a U.S. shift toward Asia and the
withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan. The
outcomes of the Arab Spring continue to be con-
tested, with the civil war in Syria escalating into
a regional conflict and Iran bent on its pursuit of
a nuclear future.
To help policymakers in Washington and
around the world grapple with this complex set
of competing priorities, Foreign Policy at Brook-
ings provides cutting-edge research and actionable
policy recommendations that promote sustainable
peace, security, and prosperity in the emerging
global order. With 40 full-time scholars, the For-
eign Policy program’s expansive research agenda
covers the world’s most critical regions, leverag-
ing Brookings’s three overseas offices—in China,
Qatar, and now India—to bring rigorous analysis
to bear on breaking developments and long-term
challenges that affect the global order.
Offering Policy Recommendations
for Obama’s Second Term
As President Obama entered his second term in
office, the Foreign Policy program released Big
Bets and Black Swans: A Presidential Briefing Book,
a set of 20 memos to the president. Foreign Policy
experts identified a number of “big bets”—policies
in which the president should invest his power,
time, and prestige—and “black swans,” the low-
probability, high-impact events that could derail
the administration’s priorities. With hard-hitting­
analyses and concrete recommendations, Big
Bets and Black Swans provides actionable policy
options on potential opportunities and crises such
as an opening in U.S.-Cuba relations, a eurozone
collapse, and a shift away from oil dependence to
green energy alternatives.
Complementing the hardcopy publication
of Big Bets and Black Swans, the Foreign Policy
program developed a unique video presentation of
the briefing book’s key assertions and a successful
digital marketing campaign. With requests for the
briefing book coming from the White House, CIA,
“Brookings
provides an
essential forum
for examining
how the United
States, Europe,
and the larger
community of
nations can
work together
to meet the
challenges of
our rapidly
changing
world.”

Riedel’s premise that
the same forces—

nomic, and political—
that contributed to
the Arab Spring are
also present in the

times from within
Saudi Arabia.

Foreign Policy
These books and monographs are based on in-
depth, scholarly research that uncovers the causes
and consequences of critical issues confronting
the United States and the international commu-
nity today. The substantive research that under-
pins each book allows Foreign Policy’s experts to
speak authoritatively, whether they are testifying
on Capitol Hill, briefing Executive Branch offi-
cials, or appearing in the media.
Foreign Policy published a number of influ-
ential books this year, covering a wide range of
­
policy-relevant topics. In Mr. Putin: Operative in
the Kremlin, Senior Fellows Clifford Gaddy and
Fiona Hill, Director of the Center on the United
States and Europe and the Stephen and Barbara
Friedman Fellow, explore the many dimensions
of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s public per-
sona—statist, survivalist, outsider, free marketeer,
and case officer. The book seeks to help policy-
makers better understand the Russian president
and to develop strong policy approaches to work-
ing with Russia’s leadership. The book reached
the highest levels of U.S. leadership, including
Vice President Joe Biden, who described the book
as “insightful” in a May 2013 interview in Rolling
Stone.
In Aspiration and Ambivalence: Strategies and
Realities of Counterinsurgency and State-Building
in Afghanistan, Senior Fellow Vanda Felbab-Brown
analyzes U.S. and international efforts in Afghani-
stan and offers detailed recommendations for
dealing with the precarious situation leading up to
the 2014 transition to Afghan control and beyond.
Felbab-Brown argues that allied efforts in Afghani-
stan have put far too little emphasis on good gov-
ernance, concentrating too much on short-term
military goals to the detriment of long-term peace
and stability. Following the publication of Aspira-
tion and Ambivalence, Felbab-Brown has been
invited on numerous occasions to brief top NATO
and International Security Assistance Force offi-
cials, as well as senior U.S. and international dip-
lomats, on matters such as the 2014 Afghan presi-
dential election, Afghan local police capabilities,
and ways to improve governance in Afghanistan.
The Brookings Press published a courageous
book, In the Name of Justice: Striving for the Rule
of Law in China, by Chinese law professor He
Weifang. Part of the John L. Thornton China
­
Center Series on Chinese Thinkers, the book
presents He’s critical assessment of the state of
Chinese legal reform. At the event launching the
book, Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer
offered his thoughts on lessons from the American
legal system for developing an effective rule of law
in China.
Protecting the Internally Displaced in Africa
W
hile the 1951 UN Convention on Refugees has helped millions around the world over the
past six decades, no globally binding international agreement exists for the almost 30
million people displaced within the borders of their own countries. To address this deficit,
the Brookings-LSE Project on Internal Displacement (IDP Project) has worked to support
the African Union’s Convention on the Protection and Assistance of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in
Africa. Known as the Kampala Convention, this agreement is the world’s first binding regional treaty on
IDPs and marks a tremendous step forward in international law on displacement. While the Convention
entered into force in December 2012, much work is still needed to translate the agreement into policies that
will improve the lives of IDPs on the ground. The IDP Project will soon publish legal commentary on the
Convention and is working with the UN and the African Union to train African political leaders in the legal
implications—and obligations—resulting from the Convention. IDP Project staff also work closely with inter-
national partners to encourage more African states to ratify the Convention and to implement it in ways
that will improve the lives of Africa’s IDPs.
Brookings India Launches
in New Delhi
With generous support from the
India Founders Circle
L
aunched in 2013 and based in New Delhi,
Brookings India establishes an indepen-
dent platform for policy research and
analysis in one of the world’s largest
emerging powers. The center focuses on the key
issues affecting India, including global and domes-
tic economic growth and stability, energy security,
and foreign policy. Joining Brookings’s other
international research centers in Doha, Qatar
and Beijing, China, Brookings India will expand
the Institution’s global reach and bring its long-
standing commitment to quality, independence,
and impact to the world’s largest democracy.
Working in concert with Brookings experts in New
Delhi, Brookings’s Washington-based India Project
will endeavor to raise the profile of the policy
issues that shape U.S-Indian relations. Brookings
India would not have been possible without the
generous and visionary support of the Brookings
India Initiative Founders Circle, a group of Indian
and American business leaders who believe in the
importance of independent policy research at this
critical juncture in India’s history.
State Department, National Security Council,
and a number of congressional offices, the memos
made an immediate impact among high-level
Washington policymakers charged with guiding
U.S. national security strategy.
Securing a New Century
The changing nature of warfare and the emer-
gence of new national security challenges require
policymakers to rethink the traditional battlefields
and domains that have guided defense and intelli-
gence efforts for decades. Brookings launched the
Center for 21st Century Security and Intelligence
in March 2013 to bring together Foreign Policy’s
extensive expertise in defense, intelligence, and
arms control and nonproliferation with an emerg-
ing capacity on cybersecurity and warfare in the
new millennium. Under the leadership of Senior
Fellow Peter W. Singer, the Center takes advan-
tage of Brookings’s deep regional and functional
expertise to shape both public understanding and
official policy on key security issues.
Investing in Deeper Research
At a time when serious discussion of U.S. foreign
policy is frequently compressed or overlooked,
Foreign Policy at Brookings remains committed
to producing book-length research and analyses.

Global Economy and Development
C
Fostering Sustainable
Prosperity for a Better World
ontinued fragility in global financial
markets and prolonged fiscal chal-
lenges in advanced economies have
demonstrated that the world economy
is an interdependent whole: trouble
in one country can have negative
ripple effects that spread beyond its borders.
Growth in emerging markets has been faster and
more resilient than in advanced countries, but in
2013 there is a clear slowdown that is not sparing
them. Economic relationships are changing, with
an expanding global middle class creating sources
of growth, while the difficulties in the eurozone
create risks for the entire world. New stories of
progress have also brought forth optimism about
the prospects for one day eliminating poverty.
Throughout the year, experts in the Global Econ-
omy and Development program have responded to
this changing landscape, improving prospects for
continued growth and prosperity.
Shaping the Next Generation
of Millennium Development Goals
As the 2015 deadline for the Millennium Devel-
opment Goals (MDGs) rapidly approaches, the
global community is taking stock of progress to

opment agenda. Brookings experts are playing a
direct role in these processes to inform, shape,
and design the next generation of the MDGs.
Senior Fellow and Deputy Director Homi Kharas
served as lead author and executive secretary of
the United Nations high-level panel that devel-
oped a framework for a new global partnership to
end poverty and promote sustainable development.
The panel’s report has become the go-to
source for policymakers and practitioners on
development goals, targets, and metrics, and will
continue to play a formative role in key debates.
In tandem, experts in the Center for Universal
Education, under the leadership of Senior Fellow
and Director Rebecca Winthrop, collaborated with
the United Nations’s Global Education First Initia-
tive to ensure that the next generation of MDGs
focuses not only on universal access to primary
school education for all children, but on the criti-
cal need for learning.

amhidzayi Berejena Mhongera wants
every girl in the world to understand
that it doesn’t matter where you come
from. Mhongera grew up in a poor vil-
lage in Zimbabwe, but that has not stopped her
from achieving success and giving back to others.
Today, she’s making sure young girls in Zimbabwe
have outlets to escape poverty.
During her time as an Echidna Global Scholar
at Brookings, she focused on her country’s strug-
gles with women’s rights and the plight of orphan
children. She notes, “Women and girls become
vulnerable to domestic violence simply because of
poverty and lack of access to information.” Since
returning to Zimbabwe, Mhongera has continued
to build on the skills she learned at Brookings to
advance her work with even more energy and
enthusiasm, including organizing the first-ever
International Day of the Girl Child event in Zimba-
bwe. She now serves as a Technical Advisor to the
Ministry of Social Services of the Government of
Zimbabwe.
The Brookings Blum
Roundtable on Global Poverty
Celebrates 10 Years
With generous support from
Richard C. Blum
I
n August 2013, the Brookings Blum Round-
table on Global Poverty celebrated its
ten-year anniversary. Thanks to the leader-
ship, foresight, and generosity of Brookings
Trustee Richard C. Blum—together with the Bill
& Melinda Gates Foundation in recent years—the
Roundtable has become a preeminent gathering
that convenes high-caliber policymakers, private
sector and civil society leaders, and academics
for focused discussions on critical topics in global
development. The tenth roundtable focused on
the role of the private sector in global develop-
ment, and featured former Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, former President of Ireland
Mary Robinson, and USAID Administrator Rajiv
Shah, among others.

national policymakers’ thinking on key macro-
economic policy questions—from how to inspire
inclusive growth in post-Arab Spring countries,
particularly Egypt and Tunisia, to Latin America’s
role in the global economy through a new partner-
ship with the Center for the Study of Economic
and Social Affairs (CERES) in Uruguay on eco-
nomic and social policy. Brookings also launched
new research on strategies for renewed growth in
Greece, Spain, and Italy, as well as hosted dia-
logues with high-ranking government officials and
experts, such as Portugal’s Minister of State and
Finance Vitor Gaspar, Leader of the Greek Oppo-
sition from the SYRIZA coalition Alexis Tsipras,
and European Commissioner for Economic and
Monetary Affairs and the Euro and Vice President
of the European Commission Olli Rehn.
In the United States, Senior Fellow Eswar
Prasad, the New Century Chair in International
Trade and Economics, presented at the presti-
gious, invitation-only Jackson Hole Symposium,
which draws prominent central bankers, finance
ministers, academic luminaries, and financial
market players from around the world. Prasad,
together with Barry Eichengreen and former
Nonresident Senior Fellow Raghuram Rajan, now
Central Bank Governor of India, reconvened the
Committee on International Economic Policy and
Reform, which comprises a dozen top academics
and former government officials. The Committee’s
second report was released in fall 2012 and has
been widely circulated to international institutions,
central banks, and regulatory agencies around the
world.
Encouraging New Global Voices
for International Policy Dialogue
Recognizing that policy solutions must be deeply
informed by the needs of people from around the
world, the Global Economy and Development
program engages a unique ecosystem of allies,
partners, and networks to develop and disseminate
innovative research. The Africa Growth Initia-
tive (AGI), led by Senior Fellow and Director
Mwangi S. Kimenyi, has partnerships with six
African think tanks to undertake joint research
and dialogue on attaining sustainable prosperity in
Africa and elevating African voices in the debate
over the future of the continent’s economies. To
foster these partners’ ability to achieve impact in
Africa and internationally, representatives of the
six think tanks traveled to Washington, DC in
2012, where they received high-level communica-
tions training and interacted with congressional
staffers and policymakers. In addition, AGI’s
annual Foresight Africa report continues to be one
of the top pieces of content on the Brookings web-
site, attracting new and expanded audiences from
Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa.
The Global Economy and Development pro-
gram also elevates voices from the developing
world through the Center for Universal Educa-
tion’s Echidna Global Scholars Program. With
the support of Echidna Giving, emerging schol-
ars, leaders, and policy advocates whose work is
focused on improving access to quality education
for girls come to Brookings for a visiting fellowship
that helps them hone their research and analytical
skills, grow networks among the international edu-
cation policy community, and develop a project to
be implemented upon their return to their home
countries. The Echidna Global Scholars leave
Brookings better equipped to contribute their
unique voices on these critical education issues
in the developing world.

Making the
Grade for
School Choice
T
he Brook-
ings
Education
Choice and
Competition Index,
compiled by Brown
Center on Education
Policy Director Grover­
“Russ” Whitehurst,
the Herman and
George R. Brown
Chair in Education
Studies, and Sarah
Whitfield, provides
essential information
to parents and poli-
cymakers to improve
school choice across
the country and
enhance performance
in public schools.
The Index is an
interactive web appli-
cation that scores the
country’s 100 largest
school districts in an
effort to create pub-
lic awareness of the
differences among
districts in their sup-
port of school choice,
provide a framework
for efforts to improve
choice and competi-
tion, and recognize
leaders among school
districts in the design
and implementation
of choice and com-
petition systems. The
Recovery School Dis-
trict in New Orleans
was the highest scor-
ing district in the 2012
index, and Louisiana
Governor Bobby
Jindal participated in
a forum recognizing
this achievement and
offered his own views
on school reform.
G
Innovative Ideas to Improve Governance
overnance Studies at Brookings
brings rigorous analysis and thought-
ful recommendations to the gover-
nance challenges facing the U.S.
and nations around the world. With
political polarization increasing and
confidence in government declining, Brookings
experts are promoting innovative ideas to reform
institutions and spark conversations to get elected
leaders to do what is needed most—govern.
Fixing the Broken Presidential
Appointment Process
The highest form of Brookings impact is when
ideas that originate with the Institution’s scholars
become the law of the land. Last year, that hap-
pened in one area that has been a leading example
of the gridlock that has paralyzed Washington.
Presidential appointments to key executive branch
positions have been stonewalled in recent years by
routine blocking of opposition nominees by both
parties, leaving important federal agencies without
leaders. On August 10, 2012, President Obama
signed the “Presidential Appointment Efficiency
and Streamlining Act,” making into law a number
of recommendations from A Half-Empty Govern-
ment Can’t Govern: Why Everyone Wants to Fix the
“We could do
no better than
to use [It’s
Even Worse
Than It Looks]
as a compelling
blueprint
for urgently
needed
reform. If
every member
of Congress
would read just
one book on
the subject, my
wish is that it
would be this
one.”
—Tom Daschle, former
Senate Majority Leader
Appointments Process, Why It Never Happens, and
How We Can Get It Done, a report by Senior Fel-
lows William A. Galston, the Ezra K. Zilkha Chair
in Governance Studies, and E.J. Dionne, Jr.
To ensure their prescriptions reached the right
audiences, Galston and Dionne briefed key con-
gressional staff members and leaders, including
Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY), who drafted
the initial legislation. The bill that resulted from
these bipartisan discussions is now law—repre-
senting a significant step toward governing more
efficiently and effectively.
Exposing the Causes
of Gridlock in Washington
While Brookings’s success in helping fix the
appointment process is a small step forward, the
problems are deeper and more
endemic. In It’s Even Worse

Building an
Innovation-Based Economy
G
overnance Studies scholars are
focused on how smart technology
policy can help the U.S. create jobs
and improve long-term economic
growth. Darrell West, Vice President and Direc-
tor of Governance Studies and founding Director
of the Center for Technology Innovation, worked
with Fellows Allan Friedman and Walter Valdivia
on an important policy paper recommending how
to foster long-term growth of the digital economy
in the United States. In addition, Fellow Elisabeth
Jacobs tackled tough questions about the daunt-
ing employment prospects for young workers
and the unemployed in today’s labor market. In a
widely-cited paper, Jacobs put forth proposals for
stronger investment in “lifetime learning” for the
unemployed.
A New Effort to Improve
Political Leadership
With generous support from the
S.D. Bechtel, Jr. Foundation
T
he Governance Studies program
launched the Management and Lead-
ership Initiative to improve national
political leadership. Led by Senior Fellow
Elaine Kamarck, the Initiative aims to enhance the
understanding of the nation’s current leadership
deficit to find ways to change leaders’ behavior
and improve leadership capacity.
In its inaugural year, the Management and
Leadership Initiative hosted several public forums,
including a discussion with then-Secretary of
Homeland Security Janet Napolitano on her lead-
ership of the agency and how America’s home-
land security environment has changed over the
last decade.
The Initiative became a part of the new
­
Center for Effective Public Management in
­
September 2013.
American Enterprise Institute, assert that partisan
polarization is at the root of America’s governing
problems.
The book generated widespread attention in
the media and among policymakers, including
being referenced by Senate leaders Harry Reid
(D-NV) and Mitch McConnell (R-KY) during
a heated debate on the Senate floor about the
state of gridlock. Ezra Klein, a columnist for The
Washington Post and Bloomberg View, in the New
York Review of Books said that Mann and Ornstein
“have done the public a great service—and have
been much braver than many in the media, the
think tanks, or Congress—in using their personal
credibility to clearly describe what has happened
to American politics in recent years, and who is
primarily to blame.” The Washington Post’s “Wonk-
blog” named it their 2012 Book of the Year. The
authors also brought their thesis to a popular audi-
ence in an appearance on The Daily Show with Jon
Stewart.
Influencing National Security
Decisionmakers
Brookings also has tremendous impact by shap-
ing debates and setting the agenda for major issues
facing the nation and the world. Lawfare, a blog
founded by Senior Fellow Benjamin Wittes and
Nonresident Senior Fellows Robert Chesney and
Jack Goldsmith, is the principal journalistic and
scholarly center for examining national security
legal issues. With more than 272,000 unique visi-
tors this year, Lawfare has become a must-read for
the nation’s top legal minds.
Lawfare fosters online discussion devoted to
the hard national security choices facing policymak-
ers and the public. Readers from the highest levels
of government, throughout the bureaucracy, the
courts, Congress, the academy, and the media turn
to Lawfare for thoughtful analysis of the merits of
the underlying legal and policy debates that define
national security’s most pressing policy issues.

Metropolitan Policy
T
Catalyzing Metropolitan Policy and Action
he Metropolitan Policy Program is
redefining the challenges facing met-
ropolitan America and promoting inno-
vative solutions to grow communities
in more productive, inclusive, and sus-
tainable ways. Metro’s efforts enable
metropolitan leaders to: (1) economically­situate
their metropolitan area in the global marketplace
through rigorous empirical research; (2) innovate
locally through co-designing metropolitan eco-
nomic growth strategies that build on their distinct
assets; (3) advocate nationally by ­
promoting state
and federal policy ideas and platforms that serve
metropolitan growth; and (4) network globally with
business, civic, and government leaders in met-
ropolitan areas worldwide to forge new trade and
investment partnerships.
Achieving Liftoff for
State and Regional Economies
As laboratories of reform, states are constantly
looking for new ways to boost their value-added
industries and create quality jobs. To this end, as
part of a new Advanced Industries Series, Metro
released Launch! Taking Colorado’s Space Economy
to the Next Level, a strategy that identifies impor-
tant steps the state can take to strengthen its aero-
“I do want to

the good work
that Brookings
has done over

and ongoing
struggle.”

space economy, which is highly concentrated in
the Denver and Colorado Springs metro areas.
Using the report as a guide, Governor John
Hickenlooper and the state legislature have passed
bills that boost investment in advanced industries
and help more companies export their goods and
services. This success in Colorado has already
become a model for other states. Metro is cur-
rently working to help Tennessee and its metropol-
itan areas develop a plan to grow their advanced
industries, especially improving the skills and
innovative capacities of its automotive sector.
Growing Exports to Increase Prosperity
One key path to long-term prosperity is the
embrace of global trade and engagement. This
year, the Brookings-Rockefeller Project on State
and Metropolitan Innovation released a ten-point
guide for government and business leaders to
develop effective metropolitan export plans, based
on the experience of four pilot plans in Portland,
Los Angeles, Minneapolis-Saint Paul, and Syra-
cuse. The guide was the basis for the Metropolitan
Export Exchange, which brought together a new
crop of leaders from geographically diverse metro
areas to learn how to create and implement their
own strategies in a structured peer-to-peer setting.

Metropolitan Policy
Key federal leaders praised Metro’s export
work, including Boeing CEO Jim McNerney,
Chair of the President’s Export Council, who
emphasized the importance of federal collabora-
tion with state and local officials to realizing the
goals of the National Export Initiative. Demand
from mayors and regional leaders to participate
in the Exchange is high. Metro plans to generate
new and updated trade data on exports, foreign
direct investment, and freight flows in the coming
year as part of the Global Cities Initiative: A Joint
Project of Brookings and JPMorgan Chase. This
research will serve as the foundation for working
with public and private sector leaders in 28 U.S.
metros—as well as select international metros—
in the coming years to help them shape export
and global engagement strategies to grow their
economies.
Starting a Metropolitan Revolution
The source of innovation and problem-solving to
today’s supersized challenges will not be Washing-
ton. That is the premise of The Metropolitan Revolu-
tion: How Cities and Metros Are Fixing Our Broken
Politics and Fragile Economy, a new book by Vice
President and Director of the Metropolitan Policy
Program Bruce Katz and Fellow Jennifer Bradley.
The book, replete with stories and its own iPad app
and webpage, shows how political gridlock in Wash-
ington is forcing U.S. cities to bypass the federal
government and develop their own plans for growing
jobs and economic opportunities. By connecting
more purposely with their surrounding metropolitan
regions, they are becoming the driving force behind
our nation’s economic growth. The book reveals why
it’s time to re-imagine the
economy, both national and
global, as a network of metro
areas growing together, linked
by trade and driven by innova-
tion. It has attracted attention
from policymakers at every
level of government, media,
and business and community
leaders who want to be part
of this revolution.
Confronting Suburban
Poverty in America
With generous support from
the Ford Foundation
T
he Ford Foundation has been a stead-
fast and generous supporter of the
Brookings Institution for decades and
has long been an invaluable partner to
the Metropolitan Policy Program. The Foundation
worked very closely with the Metro team to exam-
ine the shifting demographics of poverty in the
United States. In Confronting Suburban Poverty
in America, Metropolitan Policy Program Deputy
Director Alan Berube and Fellow Elizabeth Knee-
bone brought overdue attention to rising levels of
poverty in the suburbs.
While most Americans still carry the notion
that poverty is most prevalent in inner-city neigh-
borhoods and isolated rural areas, times have
changed. The majority of poor families in metro-
politan areas do not, in fact, live within city limits
but in surrounding sub-
urbs, which are often ill-
equipped to deal with this
socio-economic phenom-
enon, especially in these
times of flat or declining
municipal budgets. Then-
Ford Foundation President
Luis Ubiñas delivered the
opening remarks at the
book’s launch.

Investing in the
Green Movement
F
iscal challenges in Washington, DC and
state capitals are making it hard for
green, low-carbon enterprises to grow.
Senior Fellow and Policy Director Mark
Muro and several of his Brookings colleagues
identified this problem in their paper, “State Clean
Energy Finance Banks: New Investment Facilities
for Clean Energy Deployment.”
Their research chronicled the obstacles fac-
ing low-carbon energy enterprises and pointed
to the creation of Connecticut’s Clean Energy
Finance and Investment Authority as a posi-
tive sign and potential model to emulate. Since
the creation of the “green bank” in Connecticut
and the paper’s publication, New York Governor
Andrew Cuomo has pledged $1 billion to start a
green bank in New York, and Hawaii has begun to
follow Connecticut’s and New York’s lead. These
small “green banks” stand ready to make a big
impact on the nation’s energy supply by providing
a dedicated source of financing.

Addressing the Challenges
of a New Century
n the nearly 100-year history of the Brookings
Institution, global change has rarely been as
unpredictable, multifaceted, and consequential
as it is now. At the same time, U.S. partisanship
and polarization are more extreme and toxic than
at any time since the late nineteenth century,
and public trust in government is at an all-time low.
Few institutions are better positioned than
Brookings to provide the breadth, depth, and qual-
ity of research and analysis needed to meet these
challenges. As one of the world’s leading think tanks,
Brookings is launching the Second Century Cam-
paign to provide a solid foundation for this important
work in the coming century and beyond.
A Rich History, A Bold Vision
The Second Century Campaign derives from the
enduring values of the Institution itself—Quality,
Independence, and Impact.
Ensuring Quality. Brookings has long been
recognized for the excellence of its scholars and
the quality of their research. The Second Century
Campaign will help Brookings to continue attract-
ing the best scholars across many disciplines by
ensuring that resources are available to support
their work. Brookings will strive to double the num-
ber of endowed chairs and expert funds, which will
enable the Institution’s scholars to focus on their
research, analysis, and policy recommendations for
greater impact locally, nationally, and globally.
Sustaining Independence. The value that
Brookings brings to the policy debate—and to its
supporters—is rooted in the Institution’s abso-
lute commitment to independence and rigorous,
­
evidence-based study of the issues. Because the
policy recommendations that emerge from this
approach are free from ideological bias, they gain
greater traction with policymakers, the public, and
other key audiences. Further, the pace of change
in the world demands that Brookings retain the
flexibility to launch new research and convene key
stakeholders on short notice. The Second Century
Campaign will support expanded strategic initiative
funds for the President and research Vice Presi-
dents that provide secure, unrestricted funding to
advance high-quality, independent research.
Maximizing Impact. All Brookings research is
driven toward action—converting in-depth research
and pragmatic ideas into public policy. The Second
Century Campaign will bring resources to invest
in outreach capacity to ensure that policy recom-
mendations by Brookings experts reach influential
audiences in government, the private sector, and
the media. To achieve these goals, Brookings seeks

to make additional investments in 21st century
tools and strategies, including an enhanced social
media and web presence. With an expanding global
footprint—including overseas offices in China,
India, and Qatar—Brookings also seeks investments
to help bring policy recommendations to a global
audience.
Second Century Campaign Goals
To accomplish this bold vision, the Second Cen-
tury Campaign seeks to raise $600 million ahead
of Brookings’s centenary in 2016. With the out-
standing leadership of Campaign Chair and Vice
Chair of the Board Glenn Hutchins, many promi-
nent donors—including 100 percent of the Brook-
ings Board of Trustees—have already stepped
forward with unprecedented levels of support.
Brookings currently seeks gifts for the following
investment priorities:
l 
Ensuring Quality: $150 million for the endow-
ment and durable funds for Brookings experts,
programs, and facilities
l 
Sustaining Independence: $30 million for
strategic initiative funds for Brookings’s Presi-
dent and research Vice Presidents
l 
Maximizing Impact: $25 million for outreach,
social media, digital technology, and other
impact strategies
l 
Strengthening the Annual Fund: $30 million
in unrestricted, general operating funds
l 
Providing Program Support: $365 million
for research projects and initiatives across the
Institution
The Brookings Institution has more than
doubled in size in the last decade in order to meet
the growing demands for independent, pragmatic
solutions to major challenges. The Second Century
Campaign will sustain that growth and position
Brookings for a continued leading role in guiding
the critical decisions facing our nation and the
world. Brookings invites you to get involved with
the Institution for leading-edge research and analy-
sis of critical local, national, and global issues.
“As we
approach our
centennial, this
is Brookings’s
moment. The
issues facing
our nation are
of enormous
consequence and
our governing
process is often
at loggerheads.
Brookings
scholars play an
indispensable
role in crafting
solutions to the
thorniest public
policy problems.”

Second Century
Campaign Chair
The Global Cities Initiative
Goes to São Paulo
With generous support from
JPMorgan Chase & Co.
T
he Global Cities Initiative: A Joint Project
of Brookings and JPMorgan Chase is a
five-year effort to help the leaders of U.S.
and global metropolitan regions strengthen
their regional economies by becoming more competi-
tive in the global marketplace. The Initiative is built on
the concept that the global economy is a network of
metropolitan economies that are home to most of the world’s population, produc-
tion, finance, and sources of innovation. In November 2012, the Global Cities Ini-
itiative held a forum in São Paulo, Brazil, its first outside the U.S. Throughout the
week in Brazil, Bruce Katz, founding Director of the Metropolitan Policy Program,
and Richard Daley, former Mayor of Chicago and Senior Advisor to JPMorgan
Chase & Co., hosted a series of workshops, tours, and briefings that enabled the
delegation of over 40 U.S. metropolitan leaders to connect with Brazilian lead-
ers, including former President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, to boost trade and
investment. In 2013, the Global Cities Initiative is bringing its innovative approach
to fostering economic growth to four domestic forums—in Atlanta, Dallas, Denver,
and Houston—along with one in Mexico City, to continue building a global network
of cities linked by trade and shared prosperity.

grams in honor of Brookings’s Second Century
Campaign. For the Metropolitan Policy Program,
the Alcoa Foundation is providing resources to
help cities retool manufacturing and improve job
training as part of an emphasis on promoting
advanced industries to enhance U.S. competitive-
ness. In addition, the Foundation is supporting
work in Governance Studies on how federal and
state government policies can contribute most
effectively to building a workforce that has the
skills to fill the jobs of tomorrow. Alcoa Founda-
tion is also contributing to work in the Brookings
Climate and Energy Economics Program in Eco-
nomic Studies, which is using advanced model-
ing techniques to analyze possible impacts of
China’s efforts to steer its massive economy to a
low-carbon future. Under the leadership of Chair-
man and CEO Klaus Kleinfeld, who is a Brookings
Trustee, the company made a gift of general oper-
ating support that provides critical resources that
enable Brookings to bring its commitment to qual-
ity, independence, and impact to the most press-
ing challenges facing policymakers in the U.S. and
around the world.

“As we embark
on our second
century, we
are seeking
other vision-
ary individuals,
corporations,
and founda-

Brookings’s
innovative,
research-based
recommenda-
tions in this
time of unprec-

change.”
—Strobe Talbott,
President
O
ver the
course of
more than
thirty-five
years of investing in
shared priorities, the Wil-
liam and Flora Hewlett
Foundation has supported
projects and initiatives
in all five of Brookings’s
research programs. In
2013, the Foundation
made several important
grants in support of the
Governance Studies and
Global Economy and
Development programs.
Hewlett Foundation
support was critical in
establishing the Global
Economy and Develop-
ment program in 2006,
and this year it provided
dedicated funds to the
Africa Growth Initiative
(AGI) and research and
dialogue on the global
development agenda, aid
effectiveness, governance
and transparency, and
inclusive growth. Other
Hewlett Foundation
grants enabled Center
for Universal Education
experts, under the lead-
ership of Senior Fellow
and Director Rebecca
Winthrop, to collaborate
with UNESCO’s Institute
for Statistics in establish-
ing a Learning Metrics
Task Force, which seeks
to develop a set of inter-
nationally comparable
benchmarks for assessing
what students are learn-
ing. The Foundation’s
generous support for
AGI enabled Senior Fel-
low and Director Mwangi
Kimenyi and his team to
conduct high-quality pol-
icy research and analysis
focused on attaining sus-
tainable economic devel-
opment and prosperity in
Africa, with an emphasis
on amplifying the voice
of African researchers
in policymaking and
planning.
The Foundation’s
investments in Gover-
nance Studies supported
the program’s work on
strengthening American
democracy, led by Senior
Fellow Elaine Kamarck,
which aims to enhance
the understanding of
contemporary U.S. gov-
ernance challenges and
identify a comprehensive
agenda for constructive
change. Another grant
from the Hewlett Foun-
dation enabled Senior
Fellow Thomas Mann to
convene a one-day con-
ference that examined
the Supreme Court’s rul-
ing in Shelby County vs.
Holder and its impact on
voting rights and election
administration, and pros-
pects for future legisla-
tive action.

Support for Brookings

Empowering Independent Research
and Intellectual Freedom
rookings’s valued contributors play an
essential role in sustaining the qual-
ity, independence, and impact of the
Institution’s work. Since its founding,
generous support from individuals,
foundations, and corporations has
enabled Brookings experts to develop practi-
cal, enduring solutions to the most urgent policy
challenges facing the nation and the world. The
Institution’s donors also bring valuable intellectual
insights and private sector perspectives that enrich
Brookings experts’ research and strengthen their
policy recommendations.
A Catalyst for Research
and Implementation
The Brookings Council is the Institution’s core
group of individual and corporate supporters, pro-
viding crucial unrestricted funding for research,
publications, and events. Throughout the year,
members of the Brookings Council enjoyed fre-
quent opportunities to engage in thoughtful dia-
logue on timely policy topics with leading experts,
in a variety of formats.
In October, the Brookings Council was invited
to watch the final debate of the 2012 presiden-
tial campaign, which focused on foreign policy,

T
rustee Vicki Sant and her husband Roger
created a charitable remainder trust that
supports Brookings’s general operations,
helping ensure that Brookings has the
resources to sustain the excellence that defines the
Institution’s work. Vicki and Roger Sant are lead-
ing national philanthropists who have generously
supported Brookings for many years. “Including
Brookings in our estate planning was a natural way
to extend our support for the great work they do,”
Sant said. “Roger and I are pleased to be able to
help give Brookings experts the tools they need to
achieve real impact.”
Brookings Executive Education
Educating Leaders for Today’s Challenges
I
n partnership with the Olin Business School at Washington University
in St. Louis, the Brookings Executive Education (BEE) program provides
high-quality executive education to government and private sector lead-
ers. The BEE program includes certificate programs in public leadership or
policy strategy and a Master of Science degree in leadership. BEE also runs the
highly respected Legis Congressional Fellowship program, which has proven
extremely popular on Capitol Hill for providing high-quality fellows to congres-
sional offices.
BEE’s innovative Leading Thinking™ model, which teaches leaders to think
differently to improve performance, has produced a new wave of government
and industry executives who are better equipped to solve problems and lead
their organizations. As an example, a BEE Master’s student who is a strategic
planner in the Department of Defense was asked to bring together 33 agencies
to radically improve performance of U.S. missile ranges, while also lowering
costs. Applying one of the Leading Thinking™ processes to this challenge, the
student achieved consensus among the agencies on both the problem’s formu-
lation and an effective solution that saved $3 billion.
with Brookings scholars at simultaneous events in
California and New York. The California event, co-
hosted with the Center for International Security
and Cooperation at Stanford University and the
Ploughshares Fund, featured Brookings President
Strobe Talbott, while the New York event included
Managing Director Bill Antholis and Senior Fel-
lows Bill Galston and Robert Kagan. In each city,
the Brookings scholars provided key background
on the issues and engaged in a lively dialogue with
the Council members in attendance ahead of the
debate, allowing for in-depth analysis of the candi-
dates’ positions.
Taking part in events such as the debate-watch
parties is how many Brookings Council members
begin their involvement with the Institution. For
example, longtime Brookings Council member
Everett Cook has become increasingly engaged with
Brookings since participating in his first Council
event almost a decade ago. Early in his association
with the Institution, he joined two separate Brook-
ings traveling delegations on trips to India and
China, where he had the chance to interact with
Brookings experts and gain a new, more in-depth
understanding of the culture and politics of the two
nations. “My involvement with the Brookings Coun-
cil has been personally rewarding and intellectually
stimulating,” Cook said. “The events are timely and
interesting and I appreciate the dialogue with the
experts and other Council members.”
A growing number of leading companies have
realized the value of working with Brookings experts
on key issues. Brookings is delighted to welcome
Barrick Gold—the world’s leading gold producer—as
one of the newest members of the Chairman’s Cir-
cle of the Brookings Council. Canada-based Barrick
Gold operates mines and development projects on
four continents, so it can draw on Brookings experts
to better understand developments across the globe,
as well as the possible policy responses from Wash-
ington and international capitals. On a local level,
Barrick Gold’s significant operations in Nevada
mean that the Brookings Mountain West work that
all five research programs are doing in partnership
with the University of Nevada, Las Vegas offers
significant opportunities for company executives
to engage with Brookings experts. Through their
involvement with Brookings, Barrick Gold executives
have access to valuable insights into the policy chal-
lenges that can affect global businesses.
Harnessing Intellectual Power from Abroad
Brookings’s International Advisory Council com-
prises distinguished business and community lead-
ers representing 25 countries across five continents.

Welcoming New Trustees
B
rookings elected six new Trustees and two returning Trustees
to the Board in 2013. They join a distinguished group of leading
business executives, academics, and community leaders who help
govern the affairs of the Institution. The Board, which meets three
times per year, approves the fields of scholarly investigation and safeguards
the independence of the Institution’s work. Brookings welcomes its newest
members to the Board of Trustees:
global reach of its research and analysis, along with
important financial support. The International Advi-
sory Council convenes in Washington each spring
for a two-day meeting that includes conversations
with policymakers and Brookings experts, as well
as visits to important places where policy is made.
In between meetings, members of the Council take
part in events and meetings with Brookings experts
and senior leadership in Washington and abroad,
providing vital counsel and insight throughout the
year. Eight new members joined the International
Advisory Council this year:
l 
Nicolas Berggruen, Chairman, Berggruen Institute
on Governance, United States
l 
Mick Davis, Founding Partner, X2 Resources

Engaging the Next Generation
As Brookings approaches its centenary, a new
generation of donors is engaging with the Institu-
tion, fostering support and dialogue. The Robert
S. Brookings Society is a new forum for emerg-
ing leaders to take part in substantive exchanges
with Brookings experts and each other in a variety
of settings. Coupled with interactions with the
Brookings Council, their involvement with Brook-
ings gives them a solid foundation in policy issues
and their solutions.
Sustaining Brookings’s Impact
Contributions to the endowment provide a perma-
nent financial foundation for key policy priorities
and ensure an enduring legacy for the donors. An
example of this kind of critical, durable support from
this year is the establishment of the Lee Kuan Yew
Chair in Southeast Asia Policy Studies, which will
support Brookings’s expanded work on the region,
thanks to endowed support from a group of forward-
thinking donors. Named in honor of the first Prime
Minister of Singapore in recognition of his transfor-
mative leadership, this new, permanent chair in the
Foreign Policy program expands Brookings’s capacity
on East Asia-related issues, bringing important new
attention to U.S. policy toward the region. With the
U.S. increasing its focus on Asia, the addition of
the Lee Kuan Yew Chair to the Center for North-
east Asian Policy Studies—transforming it into the
Center for East Asian Policy Studies—will cement
Brookings as a premier resource for policymakers
and business leaders working in and on the region.

Understanding
a Changing World
With generous support from
UnitedHealth Group
T
he economic and political forces that
drive business decisionmaking can
interact in complex and sometimes
unpredictable ways. Continuing eco-
nomic weakness, shifting demographics, and
growth of emerging markets are just some of the
challenges facing executives trying to navigate an
uncertain business climate. To help make sense
of these trends, UnitedHealth Group’s senior
leadership looked to Brookings for analysis. With
a grant in support of Governance Studies and
the Metropolitan Policy Program, the company is
providing critical resources that enable Brookings
experts to conduct research and make policy rec-
ommendations on pressing issues. Also included
in the gift is a flexible fund that supports work on
emerging policy challenges and new priorities.

Notes:
As a nonprofit and scientific organization, ­
Brookings is exempt from federal income taxes under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal
Revenue Code. The Institution also qualifies as a publicly supported organization under section 170(b)(1)(A)(vi) of the code.
Brookings policy is to make an annual investment spending allocation for the support of operations. This amount is calculated
based on 70% of the prior year’s spending adjusted for inflation and 30% of 5% of the market value of the investments as of
December 31 of the prior fiscal year. Certain reclassifications of prior year balances have been made to conform to the current year
­presentation.
