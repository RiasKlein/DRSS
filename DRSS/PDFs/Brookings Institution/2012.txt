Economic Studies With the nation continuing to face
high levels of joblessness and an unsustainable path
of government debt, scholars in the Economic Studies
program helped shape the national economic debate, crafting
pragmatic, innovative policy prescriptions to fuel broadly shared
economic growth.
8
Global Economy and Development Fragile financial
markets and fiscal challenges threatened the global
recovery this year. Scholars in the Global Economy and
Development program worked closely with some of the world’s
leading policymakers to foster international cooperation and craft
policy solutions to promote inclusive, sustainable growth.
12
Foreign Policy Much of the world was in turmoil,
as economic, political and security crises challenged
leaders from the Middle East to Latin America to Asia
and beyond. U.S. and foreign officials turned to the Foreign Policy
program for cutting-edge analysis and strategies to reduce conflict
in the emerging global order.
16
Governance Studies Polarization and hyper-
partisanship­gripped Washington, as election-year
politics exacerbated divisions in American society.
The Governance Studies program helped to devise practical policy
reforms that can work across the political spectrum to strengthen
leadership and reinvigorate trust in democratic institutions.
20
Metropolitan Policy Building the next American
economy—one fueled by innovation, powered by low
carbon, driven by exports and rich with opportunity—
will rely on the economic growth potential of metropolitan areas.
Scholars in the Metropolitan Policy Program advanced that vision
and helped metropolitan areas leverage their position in the global
economy.
24
Impact: Finding Paths Forward Across the
spectrum of political, economic and security
challenges that faced the world, Brookings’s sound,
independent public policy research found paths forward. The
Institution’s scholars engaged with national and world leaders in
crucial dialogue, offered up-to-the-moment and on-the-ground
analysis, and developed pragmatic recommendations.
26
Brookings Priorities Brookings finds effective
solutions to policy problems by coordinating efforts
around four priority areas in which the Institution has
depth and breadth and that also correspond to the major issues
our political leaders must address. Those include: growth through
innovation, opportunity and well-being, sound energy and climate
policy and managing global change.

Support for Brookings This year Brookings
experts brought thoughtful analysis and reasoned
debate to bear on the effort to promote enduring
peace and prosperity around the globe. Their contributions
were made possible by the philanthropic support of donors who
share Brookings’s vision that independent policy research is
indispensable to how we, as a nation, govern ourselves.

N
early a hundred years after Mr. Brookings came to Washington, it’s useful to imagine what he might make of today’s
world. Some trends he would find familiar and ominous. For example, Europe—which his generation thought of as
“over there”—is grappling with the danger of backsliding into economic disintegration and resurgent nationalism.
Other developments would come as a shock to Robert S. Brookings. As a public-spirited citizen who moved to
the nation’s capital when the U.S. was beginning to assert itself as global power, he would recoil at the widespread
perception, nine decades later, that America is in decline.
As a successful manufacturer whom Woodrow Wilson recruited to apply sound business principles to government, Mr.
Brookings would be aghast at the national deficit and debt and the unfunded obligations of many states.
And as a Republican who served in a Democratic administration, he would be appalled by the extreme partisanship that
has threatened to alienate voters, poison civic discourse and paralyze the democratic process.
It’s worth remembering that Mr. Brookings was both a product of and a
participant in the social activism and political reform that flourished during
the Progressive Era. In the spirit of the time in which he lived, both major
parties, even when vying for power, shared a commitment to the judicious
use of government power in service of the public good. As a result, the 1916
contest for the White House between Wilson and Charles Evans Hughes
was marked by considerable overlap between the Democratic and Republican
programs—a far cry from the bruising, bitter and polarizing Obama-Romney
campaign of 2012.
All the more reason that Mr. Brookings would be interested in how the
Institution that bears his name has evolved.
“Over there” is now just about everywhere. Hence, it is fitting that the
world’s first national think tank is increasingly international in scope as well
as in the composition of its Board of Trustees, its staff and its leadership.
In addition to the Brookings-Tsinghua Center in Beijing and the Brookings
Doha Center covering the Arab world, we have established partnerships and
programming in Latin America, Europe, Africa and Northeast Asia. In the year
ahead we will be looking to do more work on Southeast Asia, and we hope to
open Brookings India, based in New Delhi. Our newly redesigned website,
which draws more than a million visits per month, allows us to broadcast
events to a global audience and to publish our work in Chinese, Arabic and
Spanish.
Robert Brookings would be gratified to see the impact of our research
and recommendations on major issues: managing the crisis in the eurozone;
upgrading the utility of the G-20; bending the curve of health care costs;
mitigating climate change through sustainable energy policies; maximizing the
benefits of innovative technology; harnessing entrepreneurial vigor at the level
of metropolitan centers; and repairing the dysfunction of fiscal policy and gov-
ernance at the federal level.
Our scholars are not just informing the public on these and other conten-
tious issues—they are raising the tone of the debate. Wherever Brookings
scholars speak out—whether in our seminar rooms, in our in-house TV studio,
on the web, in our multiple gateways to social networks, in congressional tes-
timony, or at conferences outside the Beltway or on other continents—they
adhere to the ethos personified by our founder and fostered by our Institution,
which we strive to make a partisanship-free zone.
I’d like to think that Mr. Brookings would be proud that we have remained
true to his values while adapting his vision to challenges that are every bit as
demanding as the ones his generation faced.
P r e s id e n t ’ s M e s s a g e
C h a i r m a n ’ s M e s s a g e

uring a time of tumult in the U.S. and around the world, Brookings remains one of the few institutions where civil
public discourse and rigorous, nonpartisan research are the order of the day. Throughout an eventful year, major pub-
lic figures used the podium in our Falk Auditorium to convey messages to—and sometimes from—the White House
and Capitol Hill, as well as to audiences around the globe.
The newly elected president of the World Bank, Jim Yong Kim, gave his first policy speech at Brookings. Within
a single week, Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, and Tim Geithner, the U.S.
Treasury secretary, laid out their recommendations for keeping the global economic recovery on track. Two senators, Democrat
Patty Murray of Washington and Republican Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania—both members of the defunct “supercommittee”—
outlined alternative proposals for avoiding a looming “fiscal cliff.” Senator Marco Rubio of Florida used a widely covered, standing-
room-only speech to expand on his foreign policy vision. A speech by Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey lambasting what he
saw as Washington’s lack of leadership on the budgetary outlook turned out to
be a preview of his keynote address at the GOP convention seven weeks later.
At a convocation hosted by our Saban Center on Middle East Policy, Shimon
Peres, the president of Israel, joined Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in call-
ing on Russia to help end the carnage in Syria. Senior Chinese policy adviser
and economist Cheng Siwei explained the priorities and significance of his
country’s latest five-year plan, which will have profound implications for the
world economy.
Throughout the year, our scholars were repeatedly invited to testify before
Congress on a range of issues. Senior Fellow Alice Rivlin appeared twice in
one week, first at the request of the Republicans, then at the invitation of
the Democrats.
Brookings scholars were once again at the forefront of the nation’s eco-
nomic debate, putting forward proposals to create jobs and restore fiscal
sanity, while our annual growth through innovation forum focused on
enhancing American competitiveness. The Global Cities Initiative brought
together metropolitan areas to develop their economies for the twenty-first
century; our World Forum on Governance developed recommendations for
reducing corruption; and the Saban Forum tackled the ongoing transforma-
tions in the Middle East.
Brookings experts led a global network of think tanks in creating ideas for the
G-20 summits in Cannes and Los Cabos and advised the leading international
financial institutions on remedies for the unfolding euro crisis. Meanwhile,
our scholars worked to improve school standards in the U.S. through empirical
research and advised the U.N. secretary-general on his global education agenda.
Worldwide economic and fiscal difficulties pose a challenge to not-for-
profit institutions like ours. Yet this past year we were able to balance our bud-
get while taking on new, mission-critical projects and investing in the latest
communication technology. As the world and America’s role in it become ever
more complex, the demand for Brookings’s work will only grow, which necessi-
tates maintaining our distinctive advantage among think tanks: the depth and
breadth of our expertise. That combination enables us to take the long view of
a wide horizon while also responding at short notice to unforeseen, sometimes
game-changing events.
To that end, we are going to work even harder to raise flexible and durable
resources as we approach our centenary in 2016. With the generous support
of donors, the guidance of our advisory councils and the prudent oversight
of my fellow trustees, I am confident we will not only live up to our motto—
“quality, independence, impact”—we will keep updating what those words
mean in a changing, increasingly interconnected world.

New Investment in the Engelberg Center
Supports Novel Approaches to Health Care Reform
U
nder the leadership of Senior Fellow Mark McClellan, Leonard
D. Schaeffer Chair in Health Policy Studies, the Engelberg
Center for Health Care Reform continued to lead the national
debate over health care and ways to reduce costs while
improving quality of care.
A $10 million gift from the Irene Diamond Fund established the Fund
for Health Care Innovation to support new and novel approaches to
reform, and the Irene Diamond Fellowship for Public Health Leadership to
match health care reform efforts with key goals, such as promoting health-
ier behaviors and preventing illnesses and disease complications. The Irene
Diamond Fund was created and funded by noted philanthropists Irene
and Aaron Diamond (both deceased). The fund supports many charitable
causes and to date has distributed more than $400 million to advance
public health and public policy, including AIDS prevention and research,
human rights and the performing arts.

T
he United States
continued to face
three critical eco-
nomic challenges
this year: high
levels of jobless-
ness, an unsustainable path of
government debt and an urgent
need for reforms to foster broadly
shared economic growth. Eco-
nomic Studies scholars helped
frame the national economic
debate, contributing rigorous,
independent analyses and inno-
vative policy prescriptions.
“The economic recovery
remains vulnerable to risks asso-
ciated with financial strains in
Europe, the confluence of expir-
ing U.S. fiscal policies known as
the ‘fiscal cliff’ and ballooning
government debt,” said Karen
Dynan, vice president and co-
director of Economic Studies
and the Robert S. Kerr Senior
Fellow. “Scholars in Economic
Studies continue to introduce
fresh yet pragmatic policies to
support the immediate recovery
and generate long-term eco-
nomic growth.”
“Our team put forth careful
analyses of the nation’s eco-
nomic recovery, along with prac-
tical solutions to our economic
challenges. We’ve issued timely
reports and opinion pieces,
testified in Congress numer-
ous times and brought together
national leaders from across
the political spectrum for civil,
nonpartisan discussions,” said
Ted Gayer, co-director of the
program and the Joseph A. Pech-
man Senior Fellow.
As policymakers struggled
to outline a “grand bargain” on
job creation and deficit reduc-
tion, they turned to Economic
Studies scholars for counsel.
Senior Fellow Alice Rivlin testi-
fied before Congress twice in
a single week, invited once by
the Democrats and once by the
Republicans. As the so-called
“supercommittee” began its
work on a budget plan, members
sought guidance from Rivlin and
former Senator Pete Domenici,
whose Medicare premium sup-
port proposal became the basis
for a bipartisan plan introduced
by House Budget Committee
Chair Paul Ryan and Senator
Ron Wyden.
Under the direction of Senior
Fellow Isabel Sawhill, the Cabot
Family Chair, and Senior Fel-
low Ron Haskins, the Budgeting
for National Priorities project
continued to develop new fiscal
policy ideas, finding common
ground among policymakers.
The Urban-Brookings Tax Policy
Center, co-directed by Senior
Fellow William Gale, the Arjay
and Frances Fearing Miller Chair
in Federal Economic Policy, ana-
lyzed the presidential candidates’
tax proposals and is gearing up to
make major postelection contri-
butions on tax reform, a crucial
pro-growth policy issue.
As issues of poverty, inequal-
ity and economic mobility came
into sharp focus, the Center on
Children and Families, co-led by
Haskins and Sawhill, became a
staple of political dialogue. Dur-
ing the primaries Republican
presidential candidates Mitt
Romney and Rick Santorum

ings losses experienced by those
who became unemployed during
the recession. Former Treasury

director of the Initiative on
Business and Public Policy and
the Bernard L. Schwartz Chair
in Economic Policy Develop-
ment, testified before Congress
on small business’s importance
in the economic recovery. Baily
later briefed President Obama on
the economic recovery, and his
work was cited by Mitt ­
Romney’s
presidential campaign.
As the debt crisis in Europe
intensified, Fellow Douglas
Elliott became a leading voice on
its global consequences. He con-
vened key events with senior EU
policymakers and testified before
Congress on how the crisis could
affect the U.S. economy.

Investing in the Future of the
Center for Universal Education
T
he Center for Universal Education, directed by Senior Fel-
low Rebecca Winthrop, worked closely this year with the UN
secretary-general’s global education initiative to provide
quality, relevant and transparent education for all children
and youth, including those most vulnerable. In addition, the center’s
ongoing research on private sector engagement in global education
has helped shape the work of the Global Business Coalition on Edu-
cation. New Brookings Trustee Hanzade Do˘
gan Boyner, a longtime
member of the Brookings International Advisory Council, provided
endowment support for the center that will ensure a permanent base
of funding for its vital work.

Amid serious concerns
about another global reces-
sion, the program provided
substantive recommendations
on the G-20’s role in renew-
ing confidence in the world
economy. Through its Think
Tank 20 effort, Global scholars
facilitated high-level discussions
with thought leaders from G-20
countries, and contributed to
the dialogue around the G-20
summit in Mexico.
Senior Fellow Eswar Prasad,
the New Century Chair in Inter-
national Trade and Economics,
continued to produce leading
research on the role of the ren-
minbi in the global monetary
system. His paper received sub-
stantial media attention, stimu-
lated discussion in major policy
circles in China and resulted in
multiple invitations for Prasad to
present at conferences through-
out Asia. Prasad also developed
an interactive and graphic
feature on the Financial Times
website entitled the “China Cur-
rency Tracker,” which explores
how China’s exchange rates have
fluctuated over time.
Economic tensions in south-
ern Europe reverberated across
the globe. With Greece at the

policymakers in Tokyo and Washington will continue to
grow in importance. Recognizing the need for additional
capacity for in-depth research and analysis on Japan and U.S.-Japan
relations, Brookings Trustee Philip Knight made a $3 million endow-
ment gift to establish the Philip Knight Chair in Japan Studies within
the Center for Northeast Asian Policy Studies. In July 2012, Brook-

State of the Union address.
As new uprisings and hotly
contested elections took place
across the Arab world, the
Saban Center for Middle East
Policy, under the new leader-
ship of Senior Fellow Tamara
Wittes, former deputy assistant
secretary of state for near east-
ern affairs, led significant inter-
national debate. Senior Fellows
Daniel Byman, Michael Doran,
Kenneth Pollack and Brookings
Doha Center Director Salman
Shaikh published a “Middle
East Memo” on Syria, drawing
attention from the White House
and the State Department. Dur-
ing the eighth annual Saban
Forum, Secretary of Defense
Leon Panetta and Secretary of
State Hillary Clinton addressed
U.S.-Israeli security concerns
and the threat of Iran’s nuclear
program. With a $7.5 million
gift of renewed support, Trustee
Haim Saban helped ensure the
Saban Center will continue its
leading role in the policy debate
about Iran, turmoil in the Arab
world and the Israeli-Palestinian
peace process.
The Brookings Doha Center
provided on-the-ground analysis
of the Arab awakening. Research
Director Shadi Hamid gained
a devoted following of 31,000

the crisis in Syria was shared by
Senator John McCain with his
1.7 million Twitter followers.
As the euro crisis deep-
ened, new security challenges
emerged. Center on the United
States and Europe (CUSE)
Director Fiona Hill, the Stephen

low and CUSE Research Direc-
tor Justin Vaïsse released the
“2012 European Foreign Policy
Scorecard”—an innovative eval-
uation of Europe’s performance.
The Arms Control Initiative
addressed nuclear arms control
and missile defense, critical
issues during the 2012 NATO
Summit in Chicago. Director of
Trustee Philip Knight

John H. White, Jr. Forum on Public Policy
J
ohn H. White, Jr., president and CEO of Taco, Inc. and a new
Brookings Trustee, made a $1 million endowment gift to Brook-
ings to establish the annual John H. White, Jr. Forum on Public
Policy, which brings together leaders from the private, public
and nonprofit sectors to identify new solutions to pressing policy
issues. The first White Forum was held in July 2012 and focused on
U.S. manufacturing policies in a new economic reality. The forum
featured Representatives David Cicilline and Don Manzullo, along
with labor and corporate leaders, journalists, and experts, discuss-
ing ways to fortify manufacturing to improve the United States’
future economic performance, social mobility and edge
in innovation.
provide input in the state-level
redistricting process.
Amid fresh criticism about
the Federal Reserve’s role in
the aftermath of the 2008
economic crisis, Senior Fellow
Sarah Binder unveiled a new
research project examining
Congress’ relationship with the
central bank, the accuracy of
recent charges leveled against
it and the need for institutional
reform.
The Center for Technol-
ogy Innovation introduced
forward-thinking solutions for
a depressed economy. West,
the center’s director, identified
multiple policy levers—from
research and development fund-
ing to immigration reform—that
can boost long-term prosperity.
West testified before Congress
on the need for a coherent
broadband strategy to enhance
private sector growth. A new
Mobile Economy Project, sup-
ported by a multiyear gift from
Qualcomm Inc., examined how
W
ith Congress
mired in
hyperpartisan
squabbles
and national
elections
looming, political leaders strug-
gled to find common ground on
pressing policy challenges. In
at least one case this year, with
the help of Governance Stud-
ies scholars, they were able to
succeed.
In the summer of 2012, both
houses of Congress agreed to do
something they have done rarely
in recent years: send a bill to
the President’s desk for signing.
The Presidential Appointment
Efficiency and Streamlining
Act of 2011, which introduced
crucial reforms into the flawed
presidential appointment pro-
cess, draws directly from the
work of Senior Fellows William
Galston, the Ezra K. Zilkha
Chair in Governance Studies,
and E.J. Dionne, Jr. Galston and
Dionne briefed key staff to fuel
momentum in the Senate—and
the newly launched Manage-
ment and Leadership Initia-
tive engaged with bipartisan
stakeholders to secure passage
in the House. This legislation
will allow the next presidential
administration to get to work
quickly on the nation’s pressing
policy challenges.
As evidenced by this suc-
cess, over the last year Gov-
ernance Studies scholars
addressed U.S. political dys-
function head on, offering prag-
matic reforms to reinvigorate
trust in democratic institutions,
strengthen leadership and fuel
economic growth.
“This year demanded solu-
tions that work across the
political spectrum to cut through
legislative gridlock and ignite
innovation,” said Darrell West,
vice president and director of
Governance Studies. “In key
areas of policy—national secu-
rity, health care and education,
institutional reform, and tech-
nology—we promoted ideas and
convened bipartisan conversa-
tions to move debate forward
and identify substantive policy
actions in a challenging political
climate.”
The program extended its
focus on effective political lead-
ership internationally. Senior
Fellow and W. Averell Harri-
man Chair in American Gover-
nance Thomas Mann, together
with the American Enterprise
Institute’s Norman Ornstein,
convened the inaugural World
Forum on Governance in
Prague, which brought together
representatives from public and
private governance communi-
ties around the world to discuss
reducing corruption globally.
Mann and Ornstein pub-
lished their best-selling book
It’s Even Worse Than It Looks,
which addressed the origins
of American political dysfunc-
tion and outlined solutions to
restore the nation’s political
institutions.
As the politically fraught
process of congressional redis-
tricting continued, Nonresi-
dent Senior Fellows Michael
McDonald and Micah Altman
monitored reform initiatives
nationwide, and their innovative
public mapping software helped
local citizens and organizations
mobile technology is creat-
ing jobs, increasing political
engagement and improving pub-
lic health.
The A. Alfred Taubman
Forum on Public Policy,
established with the generous
support of Alfred Taubman,
examined how innovative policy
reform and advanced technolo-
gies can modernize the U.S.
health care system. Leaders
from academia, business and
government came together for
a conference highlighting new
ideas for cost containment and
improved care.
President Obama’s “Race to
the Top” program sparked fierce
debate on education reform,
and the Brown Center on Edu-
cation Policy provided influen-
tial insights. Spearheaded by
Senior Fellow ­
Grover J. “Russ”
Whitehurst, the Herman and
George R. Brown Chair in
Education Studies, the center
unveiled its “Education Choice
and Competition Index,” an
interactive web application
that ranks large school districts
across the country on school
choice. Senior Fellow Tom
Loveless revealed significant
student achievement gaps in a
widely cited report, and Fellow
Matthew Chingos examined
class size, higher education
costs and state grant programs.
The ten-year anniversaries of
9/11 and the establishment of
the detention center at Guan-
tánamo Bay raised new ques-
tions at the nexus of national
security, law and liberty. The
Harvard Law School-Brookings
Project on Law and Security,
led by Senior Fellow Benjamin
Wittes, became the preeminent
source for data on these issues.
Wittes shaped the national
security debate through a brief-
ing paper submitted to Con-
gress and influential postings
on his “Lawfare” blog. Visiting
Fellow Russell Wheeler con-
tributed vital research on the
judiciary and the Senate confir-
mation process.
Examining the intersection
of religion and politics, Senior
Fellows Dionne and Galston
released a pioneering study
examining what it means to be
American in the face of increas-
ing religious, racial and ethnic
diversity. The report offered
rich insight into Americans’
attitudes toward Islam, growing
anti-immigrant sentiment and
how faith informs individuals’
political views. l

Global Cities Initiative: A Joint Project of
Brookings and JPMorgan Chase
N
ow that more than half of the world’s population lives in
urban areas, global commerce increasingly reflects the
energy and innovation of cities and metro areas. In that
spirit, the Metro Program launched the Global Cities Ini-
tiative: A Joint Project of Brookings and JPMorgan Chase, a pioneer-
ing collaboration chaired by former Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley
and directed by Bruce Katz.
Established with the support of a $10 million gift from JPMorgan
Chase, the Global Cities Initiative is designed to provide U.S. metro-
politan leaders with the tools and expertise to forge new trade part-
nerships and reorient their economies toward world markets. The ini-
tiative convened major forums in Los Angeles, Columbus and Miami
that highlighted best practices for connecting to demand abroad and
attracting global talent and capital at home. The initiative’s first event
outside the U.S. will take place in São Paulo, Brazil, in November 2012.
forum in March, the Metro
Program hosted local, state and
national leaders—including
Portland Mayor Sam Adams,
Export-Import Bank President
and Chairman Fred Hochberg
and Small Business Associate
Administrator Dario Gomez—to
examine how metro areas can
help achieve national export
goals.
To ground the broader
export story regionally, the
Metro Program guided metro-
politan leaders in Portland, Los
Angeles, Minneapolis-Saint
Paul and Syracuse in develop-
ing customized plans to double
each region’s exports through
the Brookings-Rockefeller Proj-
ect on State and Metropolitan
Innovation. These efforts were
W
ith a sputter-
ing recovery
and Wash-
ington mired
in political
polarization­,
this year saw pragmatic met-
ropolitan leaders across the
country work to grow jobs in
the short term, and retool their
economies for the long term.
The Metropolitan Policy Pro-
gram supported those efforts by
advancing a vision for the next
American economy—one fueled
by innovation, powered by low
carbon, driven by exports, rich
with opportunity for working
families and fundamentally
metropolitan in form and
function.
From the Mountain West
to the Great Lakes, the Metro
Program worked to advance
local and state policy innova-
tions that catalyze metropoli-
tan growth, spur sustainable
economic development and
create new and better jobs. In
Nevada, Governor Brian San-
doval incorporated the Metro
Program’s recommendations
into a new statewide economic
development strategy building
on distinctive industry cluster
strengths in Las Vegas and
Reno. Bruce Katz, vice presi-
dent and founding director of
the Metro Program and the
Adeline M. and Alfred I. John-
son Chair in Urban and Metro-
politan Policy, advised Governor
Andrew Cuomo on New York’s
Regional Economic Develop-
ment Council Initiative, a $785
million competition to redesign
the state’s economic growth
strategies, and spearheaded
subsequent work to inform the
state’s $1 billion investment
strategy for the city of Buffalo.
And in Michigan, Governor
Rick Snyder and the state’s
legislature used the Metro
Program’s research to guide
the efforts of a new Office of
Urban and Metropolitan Initia-
tives on economic development,
innovation and industry cluster
catalyzation.
“With gridlock dominating
national politics, metro lead-
ers were on the front lines of
the economic recovery,” said
Katz. “We worked with elected,
corporate and civic officials
to help them leverage their
strengths in the global economy,
and brought needed metro-
politan innovation back into the
national policy dialogue.”
To strengthen the fun-
damental pillars of the next
American economy, this year
the Metro Program engaged
in cutting-edge research, on-
the-ground work in states and
metro areas, substantive policy
development and network
building across the country.
Early in 2012, the program
released two major reports on
manufacturing, which experi-
enced a resurgence in the wake
of the Great Recession. These
reports documented manufac-
turing’s economic importance
in the nation’s 100 largest met-
ropolitan areas, and advanced
a first-of-its-kind policy frame-
work for increasing high-wage,
export-intensive production in
the U.S.

and Senior Fellow Amy Liu.
Los Angeles Mayor Antonio
Villaraigosa—president of the
U.S. Conference of Mayors—
called on fellow mayors to
adopt similar export plans.
Focusing on the growth
potential of clean energy, the
program introduced “Sizing
the Clean Economy,” a path-
breaking report, database and
interactive web tool that mea-
sures the economic influence
of “green” jobs in metro areas.
Co-authored by Senior Fel-
low Mark Muro and Associate
Fellow Jonathan Rothwell, the
report is a go-to resource for
policymakers in Washington
and in cities and states across
the country, and has garnered
over 700 media citations since
its release.
The Metropolitan Infrastruc-
ture Initiative, led by Senior Fel-
low Robert Puentes, convened
a major summit with Colorado
Governor John Hickenlooper
to discuss how advances in
transportation, low-carbon
energy, and manufacturing could
reshape the country’s physical
and economic landscape. Testi-
fying before the Joint Economic
Committee in November, Puen-
tes argued for needed strategic
infrastructure investments.

program’s quarterly MetroMoni-
tor provided timely analysis of
progress in the nation’s 100
largest metro areas.
These developments
occurred against the backdrop
of a rapidly diversifying popula-
tion and workforce. Senior Fel-
low William Frey documented
the rise of a “majority minority”
population, with more than half
of all U.S. births now occur-
ring to nonwhite and Hispanic
families. Senior Fellow Audrey
Singer authored a highly pub-
licized report underscoring the
U.S. labor market’s continued
dependence on both high- and
low-skilled immigrant work-
ers. In an increasingly diverse
and urbanized world, with
cash-strapped national govern-
ments pressed to revive their
economies, the Metro Program
is revealing how globally con-
nected, innovative metro areas
can power national economic
growth and opportunity through
the 21st century. l

n 2012, political, eco-
nomic and security chal-
lenges deepened across
the nation and around the
world. Millions of Ameri-
cans struggled to find
work as political dysfunction
hindered progress on urgent
policy challenges. The global
economic recovery was threat-
ened by the debt crisis that
spread across Europe and the
slowing of Asian economies.
And dramatic political changes
continued to unfold across the
Middle East, even as Iran’s
nuclear program heightened
international concern.
Across the policy horizon,
Brookings’s sound, indepen-
dent public policy research
found paths forward. Brook-
ings scholars engaged with
national and world leaders in
dialogue, offered up-to-the-
minute and on-the-ground
analysis, and developed prag-
matic recommendations.
Through writing, convening
and relationships with poli-
cymakers and other thought
leaders, Brookings research
helped to set the agenda,
shape the debate and define
the policy options on the
world’s most pressing matters.
As a result of the Institution’s
impact in the policy arena
and beyond, the University of
Pennsylvania’s Think Tanks
and Civil Societies Program
again ranked Brookings the
number one think tank in the
world.
“As Brookings approaches
its hundredth year, our highest
calling remains informing real-
world thought and action,”
said Brookings President
Strobe Talbott. “With schol-
ars testifying 45 times before
Congress this year, and advis-
ing world leaders at high-level
summits and private meetings

Paul
Morigi

around the world, our experts
are crafting solutions that
can be implemented now and
shaping the policy agenda for
the years to come.”
Perhaps no issue symbol-
izes Brookings’s ability to
set the agenda more than
understanding the framework
for American power. Arguing
against those who claim that
America’s global power is wan-
ing, early in 2012 Senior Fel-
low Robert Kagan published
The World America Made and
reshaped the debate about
America’s influence in an
emerging multi-polar global
order. Republican presidential
candidate Mitt Romney regu-
larly cited Kagan’s work in his
arguments for American excep-
tionalism. So too did President
Obama, who made Kagan’s
argument a central theme in
his State of the Union address,
when he said “anyone who
tells you that America is in
decline or that our influence
has waned doesn’t know what
they’re talking about.”
Brookings remained at the
forefront of the fiscal policy
debate, with research by schol-
ars in the Economic Studies
program cited 14 times in
the Economic Report of the
President released by the
President’s Council of Eco-
nomic Advisers. Senior Fellow
Alice Rivlin continued to drive
the conversation about fiscal
priorities on Capitol Hill, both
in private meetings with law-
makers and in congressional
testimony. Rivlin’s Medicare
premium support plan, devel-
oped with former Senator
Pete Domenici, became the
basis for a widely debated
proposal introduced by Demo-
cratic Senator Ron Wyden
and Republican Congressman
Paul Ryan—a rare instance of
bipartisan cooperation.
As the U.S. economy
sputtered, the rise in income
inequality came into sharper
focus. Senior Fellows Isabel
Sawhill and Ron Haskins,
who co-direct the Center on
Children and Families, were
instrumental in revising the
way the U.S. Census Bureau
measures poverty to dramati-
cally increase accuracy. On the
presidential campaign trail,
Governor Mitt Romney and
Senator Rick Santorum cited
Sawhill and Haskins’ joint
research on expanding eco-
nomic opportunity for
low-income Americans.
As the deep economic
crisis in Europe continued
to threaten recovery in the
United States, Brookings
scholars engaged with World
Bank and IMF leaders to grap-
ple with the eurozone’s chal-
lenges and their implications
for global markets. Senior Fel-
low Eswar Prasad was among
the Global Economy and
Development scholars who
advised the G-20 process prior
to June’s summit in Mexico.
And as nations came together
for the Fourth High Level
Forum on Aid Effectiveness in
Busan, Senior Fellow Homi
Kharas shaped the forum’s
agenda and chaired its plenary
session.
Perhaps the greatest mark
of success is when a Brook-
ings idea becomes law. Last
year, the Senate passed bipar-
tisan legislation to address the
flawed presidential appoint-
ment process based on the
recommendations of Senior
Fellows William Galston and
E.J. Dionne, Jr. The Gover-
nance Studies Initiative on
Public Sector Leadership
worked this year to galvanize
support for similar legisla-
tion in the House of Repre-
sentatives—and in August,
President Obama signed the
Presidential Appointment Effi-
ciency and Streamlining Act
into law. Drawn directly from
Galston and Dionne’s work,
this crucial step toward reform
will improve the way our gov-
ernment functions.
As Washington remained
gridlocked, Brookings research
also highlighted policy solu-
tions from state, local and
metropolitan leaders to foster
job creation and innovation.
The Metropolitan Policy
Program crafted regional
economic development plans
to harness the power of met-
ropolitan areas as engines of
job creation and sustainable
growth. The Metro Program
worked with Mayor Rahm
Emanuel to design and imple-
ment a multifaceted economic
development plan for Chicago,
including a first-in-the-nation
local infrastructure bank.
Collaborating closely with
metropolitan leaders, Senior
Fellows Alan Berube and Mark
Muro and Fellow Jennifer
Bradley developed customized
export plans for Portland, Los
Angeles, Minneapolis-Saint
Paul and Syracuse to double
regional exports. Through its
new Global Cities Initiative,
the Metro Program introduced
a new strategic vision for help-
ing U.S. cities and metropolitan
areas emerge as global leaders
in manufacturing and trade.
Ranked this year as the
country’s most widely cited
think tank by Fairness and
Accuracy in Reporting, Brook-
ings reached more audiences
than ever before through stra-
tegic communications outreach
and critical investments in tech-
nology. The Office of Commu-
nications launched a redesign
of Brookings’s award-winning
website with enhanced multi-
media and social media tools to
streamline presentation of key
data for policymakers, the press
and the public. The Office of
Communications also launched
a series of on-the-record media
roundtables that engaged report-
ers and editors from the New
York Times, the Associated
Press, the Los Angeles Times
and numerous others. And the
communications team dramati-
cally expanded data visualization
to produce more than 60 web
graphics that appeared on the
websites of major news orga-
nizations, from the Wall Street
Journal to the Huffington Post. l
Finding Paths Forward
Distinguished Fellows Deepen Brookings’s Impact
A
s part of Brookings’s engagement of outstanding public
servants in our mission, the Institution has created a

Brookings Priorities
B
rookings’s impact
stems not only
from the work of
individual scholars,
but from collabor-
ative research that
engages experts from across
the Institution, bridging local,
national and global perspec-
tives on the issues. This,
along with the ability to con-
vene policymakers, business
leaders and non-governmental­
experts to find solutions, is
one of Brookings’s distinctive
strengths. This year, inter-
disciplinary teams of schol-
ars came together to craft
effective policy strategies on
pressing social, economic and
environmental challenges.
Their work focused around
Brookings’s core set of priori-
ties—growth through innova-
tion, opportunity and well-
being, energy and climate,
and global change.
“Each of Brookings’s
key priorities corresponds
to the Institution’s unique
strengths—and in each area,
we developed creative and
workable ideas for policymak-
ers and other world leaders,”
said Brookings Managing
Director William Antholis.
“This cross-program collabo-
ration results in multifaceted
solutions that ultimately
deepen their impact.”
With the U.S. economy
still struggling in the wake of
a deep recession—and endur-
ing the longest uninterrupted
period of high joblessness
since the Great Depression—
scholars in the Metropolitan
Policy, Economic Studies
and Governance Studies
programs worked to find
solutions to spur long-term
economic prosperity. Early
in the year, Brookings con-
vened a major conference on
growth through innovation
that brought together govern-
ment officials and CEOs of
leading U.S. businesses to
discuss ways to strengthen
America’s economic competi-
tiveness and new innovations
in technology.
During the full-day confer-
ence, then-Secretary of Com-
merce John Bryson delivered
a keynote address on the role
the federal government must
play in spurring innovation
and effective economic devel-
opment. Prominent business
leaders—including Andrew
Liveris, president and CEO
of Dow Chemical Company;
John Surma, chairman and
CEO of U.S. Steel; and Ted
Leonsis, chairman and CEO
of Monumental Sports and
Entertainment—highlighted
the role of the private sector
in boosting economic growth.
Brookings trustees, includ-
ing Klaus Kleinfeld, chairman
and CEO of Alcoa; Dominic
Barton, worldwide managing
director of McKinsey & Com-
pany; and Shirley Jackson,
president of Rensselaer Poly-
technic Institute, also shared
their perspectives.
Poverty and economic
mobility rose to the top of the
domestic and international
policy agenda in the wake of
the global recession. Scholars
in the Metropolitan Policy,
Economic Studies and Global
Economy and Development
programs fostered critical
dialogue on policies that
can strengthen opportunity
and well-being for citizens
around the world. The Metro
Program introduced ground-
breaking work on where
poverty is concentrated in
the United States; Economic
Studies experts focused on
what fiscal and social policy
change is needed to increase
economic mobility and reduce
poverty; and in Global Econ-
omy and Development, schol-
ars addressed how to improve
the effectiveness of foreign
aid and achieve universal
education.
Experts across the Foreign
Policy, Economic Studies
and Metro programs con-
tinued crucial research on
energy and climate issues.
The Energy Security Initia-
tive joined with the Brook-
ings Doha Center to host a
landmark international forum
examining the economic and
strategic implications of rising
energy trade between Middle
Eastern and emerging Asian
economies; Economic Studies
scholars examined the fiscal
and environmental implica-
tions of a carbon tax and
the controversial Keystone
XL Pipeline; and the Metro
Program developed the first
comprehensive analysis of the
clean economy’s size, charac-
ter and growth.
A rapidly shifting interna-
tional order and new secu-
rity challenges emphasized
the need to manage global
change. This year, experts in
the Foreign Policy, Economic
Studies and Global Economy
and Development programs
launched a major project to
examine the ongoing crisis
in the eurozone, the status
of the European Union and
the impact on the global
economic recovery. Joining
together to address growing
global concerns around cyber-
security, the 21st Century
Defense Initiative in Foreign
Policy and the Governance
Studies program began
first-of-its-kind research on
advances in military and
security technology and the
advent of “cyberwar.”
Campaign 2012
As the contentious 2012
presidential campaign
began in earnest, Brookings
launched the Institution-wide
Campaign 2012 project to go
beyond the polls and sound
bites of election year politics
and examine the most critical
public policy matters facing
the country. Led by Gover-
nance Studies Senior Fellow
Benjamin Wittes, Campaign
2012 looked at twelve major
domestic and foreign policy
issues—from the federal
deficit to terrorism—that the
next presidential administra-
tion must grapple with in
the coming years.
Scholars from across the
Institution published policy
briefs, short essays and blog
posts assessing these issues
and outlining independent,
fact-based ideas to forge a
path forward. The project
also hosted a series of live
webcast events, moderated
by ­
Politico journalists,
to ­
foster discussion among
Brookings scholars, journal-
ists and the public and to
highlight new policy rec-
ommendations. All of the
papers produced by Cam-
paign 2012 were published
in a book that was released
this spring. Together, they
serve as a roadmap for the
next presidential adminis-
tration on issues of critical
importance to American
­
voters, regardless of party
affiliation. l

n its third year as a partnership
between Brookings and Washington
University in St. Louis’ John M. Olin
Business School, Brookings Execu-
tive Education continued the five-decade
tradition of Brookings training for the
federal workforce, offering innovative
educational opportunities rooted in the
Institution’s rigorous policy research and
the Olin School’s business expertise.
“In a time of severe fiscal challenges,
we are providing today’s public sector
leaders with high-value, high-impact
courses to expand critical skills,” said
Jackson A. Nickerson, director of Brook-
ings Executive Education and a professor
of organization and strategy at the Olin
Business School. “Over 750 senior execu-
tives and managers are enrolled in our
Certificate in Public Leadership program,
now recognized as a mark of distinc-
tion among senior leaders in the federal
bureaucracy.”
Brookings Executive Education’s
signature Master of Science in Leader-
ship—one of the few of its kind in the
country—continued to grow. The degree
offers government leaders a curriculum
based on Office of Personnel Manage-
ment guidelines. Through Olin Business
School’s participation in the Yellow Rib-
bon Program, many veterans who have
valiantly served the nation are now taking
advantage of Brookings Executive Educa-
tion’s world-class instruction.
The new “Inside Government” series
on domestic policies allowed participants
to hear directly from administration offi-
cials, congressional leaders and Brookings
scholars. And the “Critical Issues” series
addressed global policy challenges, from
security in the Middle East to the emerg-
ing economies in East and South Asia.
Two new certifications were
launched this year. The Certificate in
Policy Strategy helps agency, corporate
and nonprofit executives leverage crucial
policy opportunities. Designed spe-
cifically for human resource managers,
the Certificate in Talent Development
includes an accredited 12-day Coach
Development Program.
Through the new “BEE with YOU”
program, Brookings brought executive
education directly to agency locations
across the country—including the U.S.
Transportation Command at Scott Air
Force Base and the Army Contracting
Command at Redstone Arsenal. And
a custom program designed for the
Department of Veterans Affairs was sub-
mitted to the President’s Management
Council as a potential model for other
government agencies. l

A
t its core,
Brookings’s
strengths come
from its people.
The Institution
brings together
the very best scholars—thought
leaders with first-rate academic
credentials and practical experi-
ence in government and the pri-
vate sector—in an environment
of intellectual freedom. It gives
them the tools they need to
pursue their ideas and possible
solutions and then disseminate
them to influential audiences.
This is only possible with the
philanthropic support of donors
who share the Brookings vision
that independent policy
research is indispensable to
how we, as a nation, govern
ourselves.
Leadership Gifts Build
a Platform for Sustained
Excellence
In 2012, donors demonstrated
their confidence in Brookings
with investments of more than
$118 million in new commit-
ments, the highest one-year
total in the Institution’s history.
These resources, which sup-
port work in all five research
programs and underwrite core
operations, provide the solid
foundation that enables Brook-
ings to respond to national and
global challenges with inde-
pendent, fact-based research.
Major support from Brookings
Trustees and other individuals,
corporations and foundations
advanced research priorities in
key areas and helped ensure
the long-term financial health
of the Institution.
Brookings is grateful to its
entire family of supporters—the
people and institutions whose
financial contributions bring
the critical resources that make
it possible for Brookings to
engage with policymakers and
thought leaders around the
world. A number of important
gifts are highlighted throughout
the pages of this report, and
these, along with several other
major investments, helped
ensure that Brookings experts
had the tools to bring their
intellectual heft and method-
ological rigor to even the most
vexing problems facing the
country.
Examples of these criti-
cal investments in Brookings
include Trustee Vicki Sant’s
commitment to Brookings’s
general operations and to
the Center on Children and
Families. The Turkish Indus-
try and Business Association
established a new senior fellow
position in the Center on the
United States and Europe that
gives CUSE enhanced capacity
to address the pressing issues
in the U.S.-Europe relation-
ship, including work on Turkey.
Brookings also renewed its
partnership with the University
of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV),
which includes both the Metro
Program’s work on the moun-
tain west and the innovative
Brookings Mountain West
program of scholar residencies,
with a four-year, $6 million gift
from UNLV.
Even as they tackle the
most pressing front-page issues,
Brookings experts always have
one eye on the challenges loom-
ing just over the horizon, so
multiyear gifts that enable both
sustained attention to ongoing
issues and nimble responses to
breaking developments are par-
ticularly valuable. As Brookings
works to meet these challenges,
the support and involvement of
the Institution’s donors play a
vital role in building its capac-
ity to bring innovative solutions
and frame the public debate.
the Brookings Energy Security
Initiative, examined the grow-
ing role of domestic natural gas
supplies.
Senior Fellow E.J. Dionne,
Jr. and Council members in
Greenwich explored the impli-
cations of the possible elec-
tion outcomes for U.S. foreign
policy and its role in the world.
Senior Fellows Tom Mann, the
W. Averell Harriman Chair in
American Governance, and
Sarah Binder led a conversation
in Washington about the key
causes and implications of the
dysfunctional state of American
politics.
In all of these events, mem-
bers of the Brookings Council
had the opportunity to pose
questions to the participating
Brookings experts and engage
in a thoughtful discussion of
the pressing issues of the day.
Brookings strives to not only
bring innovative thinking to the
most difficult problems facing
the country and the world, but
to also draw on the views of
Council members, whose expe-
riences on the front lines of the
private sector help inform the
Institution’s research.
Corporate Donors
Make Critical Investments
in Brookings
Brookings has long worked
closely with the corporate com-
munity to maximize the reach
and impact of its experts’ policy
recommendations. Since the
Institution’s founding nearly a
century ago, private sector lead-
ers who understand the crucial

complimentary publications and
other interactions with Brook-
ings leadership and scholars.

012 marked 50 years on the Brookings Board of Trustees for
Louis Cabot, who served as chair from 1986–1992. When Louis
joined the Board in 1962, Brookings had just moved into its
new headquarters at 1775 Massachusetts Avenue, just east of
Dupont Circle, from its original home on Jackson Place. John F. Ken-
nedy was in the White House and the Cuban Missile Crisis was about
to begin. In his half-century of service to Brookings, Louis has guided
the Institution in helping the nation meet its most difficult challenges.
Throughout, he has embodied the qualities that have made Brookings
the world’s leading think tank: a dedication to independent thought
and the value of intellectual pursuits. At the June Board meeting,
current Chair John L. Thornton presented him with a framed copy of
the 1962 Brookings Annual Report as a token of the Institution’s grati-
tude for five decades of support, counsel, and unwavering leadership.
role of independent research and
analysis have made financial and
intellectual investments in the
Institution’s mission. Their sup-
port provides the resources that
underwrite Brookings’s research
agenda and the communica-
tions and outreach tools that are
essential to reaching a broad and
influential audience.
More than 130 companies
joined the Brookings Council in
2012, giving their senior execu-
tives frequent, exclusive oppor-
tunities to engage with Brook-
ings experts and their work.
Brookings values the insights
and experience that these corpo-
rations bring to a range of public
policy issues, as well as the
respect these companies hold
for the Brookings brand of high-
quality, independent research
that seeks to make a difference.
All of these companies recognize
the unique value that the Insti-
tution brings to understanding
developments in Washington
and around the world and the
policy responses to urgent and
enduring challenges.

Wolfers can continue to attract
top economists as paper authors

Brookings also received
multiyear support from Liberty
Mutual for the work of experts
in the Foreign Policy and
Global Economy and Develop-
ment programs. As a global
company competing in a variety
of markets, Liberty Mutual’s
executive leadership recognized
that Brookings’s independent
research on global trends—the
growth of the middle class
worldwide, the rise of emerging
markets and democracies, and
the evolution of multilateral
institutions like the G-20—
could help U.S. industry under-
stand important developments.
The company’s support for
Brookings includes work on the
critical countries and regions—
China, India, Russia, Latin
America, Southeast Asia and
Europe—that drive the global
economy.

Foundations Support
Important Research Efforts
Private philanthropic founda-
tions have been making impor-
tant investments in Brookings
research programs for decades.
The resources they provide are
vital to ensuring that the Institu-
tion’s experts can take on the big-
gest challenges facing the nation
and the world and come up with
practical, effective solutions.
The Ford Foundation is
among Brookings’s most long-
standing supporters, with major
grants dating back more than
half a century. Ford’s support
has spanned the entire Institu-
tion, with key investments in
topics ranging from urban pol-
icy to energy policy and across
the world, from Latin America
to Europe to Asia. In 2012,
Ford made grants to Brookings
totaling more than $1.5 million,
which included a major renewal
of its support for the Metropoli-
tan Policy Program’s work on
enhancing opportunity in the
next economy for low-income
workers and families. Ford also
invested in an effort in the Gov-
ernance Studies program, led by
Senior Fellows E.J. Dionne, Jr.
and William Galston, the Ezra
K. Zilkha Chair in Governance
Studies, that examines the
intersection of faith, religion
and public policy.

Notes:
As a nonprofit and scientific organization, ­
Brookings is exempt from federal income taxes under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal
Revenue Code. The Institution also qualifies as a publicly supported organization under section 170(b)(1)(A)(vi) of the code.
The Brookings policy is to make an annual investment spending allocation for the support of operations. This amount is calculated
based on 70% of the prior year’s spending adjusted for inflation and 30% of 5% of the market value of the investments as of December 31
of the prior fiscal year. Certain reclassifications of prior year balances have been made to conform to the current year ­
presentation.

B R O O K I N G S P R E S S

n an age when new com-
munications technologies
have accelerated the speed
of public debate without
necessarily improving its
content, Brookings remains
committed to e-books and the
printed word. Book-length
treatments of the world’s most
pressing issues remain critical
tools for setting the agenda and
shaping the debate among poli-
cymakers, journalists, business
executives and other thought
leaders.
Deep partisan divides, com-
bined with heated election-year
politics, dominated policy dis-
course and hindered progress on
crucial challenges in the United
States. Brookings scholars from
across the Institu-
tion worked to
get ahead of the
political process by
presenting authori-
tative analyses of
the most critical
policy tests awaiting
November’s winner
in Campaign 2012:
Twelve Independent
Ideas for Improving
American Public
Policy. Edited by
Senior Fellow Benjamin Wittes,
this volume is the capstone of
the all-Brookings Campaign
2012 project. It offers compre-
hensive and pragmatic recom-
mendations on issues ranging
from fiscal policy and political
dysfunction to a transforming
Middle East and the threat of
terrorism. The Brookings Press
sped the publication of this and
other high-quality manuscripts
more quickly than most aca-
demic presses, putting them
onto bookshelves in time for
maximum impact.
Amid debate about whether
America is declining as a world
power, the Brookings Press
released several titles offering
new perspectives on the Obama
administration’s foreign policy
performance. In Bending His-
tory: Barack Obama’s Foreign
Policy, part of the Brookings
Press FOCUS Series, Vice
President and Director of For-
eign Policy Martin Indyk and
Senior Fellows Kenneth Lieber-
thal and Michael O’Hanlon
argue that President Obama has
been a foreign policy pragmatist,
tackling issues thoughtfully one
at a time, but without strategic
coherence to connect serious
global challenges.
Jeffrey A. Bader, recently
named the John C. Whitehead
Senior Fellow in International
Diplomacy, examines East Asian
policy in Obama and China’s
Rise: An Insider’s Account of
America’s Asia Strategy. Drawing
on Bader’s time as an advisor to
President Obama’s first presi-
dential campaign and his sub-
sequent work with the National
Security Council, the revealing
narrative offers a firsthand look
at the administration’s efforts to
stabilize relations with China
in the face of Beijing’s rising
assertiveness.
With revolution still unfold-
ing, Brookings scholars led inter-
national debate on the uprisings
that spread across the Middle
East from Tunisia. In The Arab
Awakening: America and the
Transformation of the Middle
East, Brookings’s Middle East
experts explain key aspects of
the turmoil—from the role of
social media to socioeconomic
and demographic conditions to
the influence of Islamists. Now
the standard reference on the
Arab awakening, the volume
is used by policymakers and
other thought leaders seeking to
understand the shifting political
order within Arab nations.
Focusing on the need for
effective foreign aid in a rapidly
changing global environment,
Catalyzing Development: A New
Vision for Aid outlined game-
changing strategies to help
fragile countries out of poverty.
Edited by Senior Fellow Homi
Kharas, the book was instru-
mental in shaping the agenda
and discussions at the Fourth
